1
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
You doing well?

2
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,930
Hey.

3
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah, I have to go.

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,810
- Already?
- I've got an appointment.

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,730
- I'll call you, OK?
- Sit back down.

6
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,690
- Did you sleep well?
- Mhm.

7
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,570
- Should I make us another coffee?
- That'd be nice, but I'm late.

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,330
- What're you doing tonight?
- Nothing, I bet.

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,930
Why?

10
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,670
- Because I have a thousand things to do.
- What do you have to do?

11
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Hi.

12
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Hello.

13
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Shit.

14
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,690
So.

15
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,290
Niko Fischer,
you tested positive for alcohol

16
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,850
at a traffic stop again, correct?

17
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,240
- That is correct, yes.
- Are you nervous?

18
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,890
- A little.
- You don't have to be.

19
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,050
It's going to go on your
driver's license anyways, right?

20
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,120
Hm?

21
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,680
- Mhm.
- MPE. Do you know what that means?

22
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Medical-Pyschological Examination.

23
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
More commonly known as?

24
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,960
- The idiot-test?
- Correct.

25
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,520
"Idiot-test." And who are you
calling "Idiot?" Me or you?

26
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
- Me.
- Because?

27
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,370
Because I've made an idiot
of myself

28
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,800
and you have to check whether or not
I'm allowed to drive again.

29
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,410
Right. Well done.

30
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,330
So, last time we picked you up
with 0.7 parts per million.

31
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,320
That's very close to dodging
the legal limit, no?

32
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,840
If you're driving,
you shouldn't drink at all.

33
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,690
- But one glass is OK, right?
- No.

34
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,530
- Not if you're driving.
- But, I mean, 0.7 parts per million...

35
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,290
My wife is just as drunk after
three rum balls in the evening.

36
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,010
Is my wife endangering the
the roadways?

37
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,690
I'd say that too, but...

38
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,410
If your wife was at 0.7 ppm after
three rum balls,

39
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,210
the law does not allow her to drive.

40
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,730
Are you really so concerned with that?
Laws, Rules?

41
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,090
- I studied law once.
- Oh great, a lawyer.

42
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,600
I never finished.

43
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,000
Why?

44
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,170
Because I dropped out.

45
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,320
Why?

46
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,930
Because...

47
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,970
Because I'd noticed,
that perhaps it wasn't for me.

48
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,130
- What did your parents say about that?
- They weren't happy.

49
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,130
- But now you have a good job?
- Yeah. Yeah, very good. Good.

50
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,050
- Mhm.
- Are you in a relationship?

51
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,090
- Mr. Fischer.
- Ja?

52
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,160
- A relationship?
- I understood you.

53
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,530
- Was?
- I understand you.

54
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,320
But I've noticed
that you don't want to answer me.

55
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,290
I don't want to appear hopeless,

56
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,850
but do such direct questions about
my private life really pertain here?

57
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,370
- Direct?
- Yes.

58
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,770
I can be a lot more direct.
Are you gay?

59
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Do you have complexes,
because you're so â¦ so small?

60
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,130
Are you an alcoholic,
because you're so teeny-weeny?

61
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,210
I'm not an alcoholic.
Some months I don't even drink.

62
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,680
Not drinking is not drinking,
and 0.7 ppm is 0.7 ppm.

63
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,240
- Have you already been drinking today?
- No.

64
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,130
No coffee, no water?

65
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,730
Ugh. Of course I've drunk water.

66
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,010
Oh -- so by "drinking" you mean alcohol?

67
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
- I misunderstood you.
- How have you misunderstood me?

68
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
- I didn't thinkâ¦
- What?

69
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,010
That it was a leading question.

70
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,530
A leading question! Mr. Fischer, please.
I'm no linguistic acrobat.

71
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,920
I'd also like to make
an evening of it.

72
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,320
- That can't happen. No driver's license.
- Why?

73
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,570
You're emotionally unbalanced.

74
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,090
Your living situation
suggests a relapse.

75
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,090
- You can't judge that yet.
- No?

76
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,370
So.

77
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've already done that.

78
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Beautiful day, anyways.

79
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,600
- Good morning.
- Morning.

80
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,730
- What'll it be.
- A coffee to go.

81
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
- To go?
- Mhm.

82
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,690
- And for you?
- Black coffee.

83
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,210
Don't you want to try something new?
Today's special is a Maroccino.

84
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,890
With a chocolate donut for two euros more.
Homemade and organic.

85
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,930
Mhm, I'll just take the coffee.

86
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,050
All right. We've got "CafÃ© Arabica"
or "Columbia Morning."

87
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,880
Which one is regular coffee?

88
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,320
- They both taste good to me.
- Great. I'll take the Columbia, then.

89
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,810
The Colombia. Very well.

90
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,080
- Should I add milk?
- No.

91
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
- Soy milk?
- Please, no.

92
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,840
All right. â¬3.40, please.

93
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,570
- Without the special? Just the coffee?
- Yeah, â¬3.40.

94
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,120
- 3.40 for a coffee?
- That's the Colombia.

95
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,440
You have to say that.
I have 2.20...

96
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,210
60, 70...

97
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
80.

98
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,530
- That's not enough.
- Couldn't you make an exception?

99
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,730
Sorry, I can't do that.

100
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,570
Then ten other broke people
will suddenly want a coffee.

101
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
- Brokes?
- Yeah, brokes.

102
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,450
Okay.

103
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,250
Hello, Mrs. Mosebach.
It's Niko Fischer.

104
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,930
Could I speak with my father?

105
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,930
Could you tell him to call me?

106
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,570
Yes?

107
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,440
- You've been dragged away, right?
- For a couple weeks. Why?

108
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,360
Karl Speckenbach, we live above you.
I'd like to introduce myself. Welcome.

109
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,440
- Wow. Thanks.
- As a welcome present. Meatballs.

110
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,010
- From my wife.
- That's lovely.

111
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,600
She was in the kitchen the whole morning.
I swiped two already.

112
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,530
They're really good. Try one.

113
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,770
They're good?

114
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,530
Mhm.

115
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,000
- Moving's a lot of work.
- I'm not even done yet.

116
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,160
I watched you hauling stuff.

117
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,330
I'd gladly help you, but my wife says
that I should be careful with my back.

118
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,970
- A herniated disc.
- That doesn't sound good.

119
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
What doesn't sound good?

120
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,440
- The thing with your back.
- Oh, that. It's not so bad.

121
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,170
As you said, I'm being dragged away.
I can't offer you anything more.

122
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,250
Cheers.

123
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,250
Did you see
the soccer game yesterday?

124
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,800
- No.
- Sensational game.

125
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,410
- Do you like soccer?
- Sometimes.

126
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, I'm crazy about soccer.

127
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,370
I've build myself a hobby-room
in the cellar.

128
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,960
With a couch, Foosball table,
flat screen and everything.

129
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,370
I watch all the games there.
Sometimes a little movie, too.

130
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,090
- Oh. Is that your daughter?
- It's an old photo.

131
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,010
These are your words, right?

132
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,080
Where was that taken?

133
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,170
Paris.

134
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,650
Paris...

135
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,200
Somehow, I'm jealous of you.
Young and in love.

136
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,290
Children are probably the issue.

137
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,890
Do you have children?

138
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,280
With me and my wife, pretty much
nothing worked. Nothing.

139
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,210
We were so driven before.
But after five years we stopped trying.

140
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,920
Cancer. Breast cancer.
From today to tomorrow.

141
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,530
They removed the whole thing.

142
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,890
I tried.

143
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,000
I'd like to explain it.
But it doesn't work, I can't do it.

144
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Instead, I live

145
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,810
in the cellar

146
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,600
and she is above in the kitchen
and cooks and cooks

147
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,160
and cooks and cooks.

148
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
What should I do?

149
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,090
What should I do now?

150
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,530
Do you have anyone
you can talk about it with?

151
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,210
What then?

152
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,600
I don't know.
Maybe a â¦ an old friend?

153
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,520
These damn women,
they end you, totally end you.

154
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,970
Uah.

155
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,640
Yes?

156
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,970
Matze, hello.

157
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,000
- Someone should clean up this city?
- Hm?

158
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,080
Someone should clean up this city.

159
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,450
Because it's a pile of shit.

160
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
I get a headache,

161
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,410
when I take a walk,
and have to smell the filth.

162
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,450
Unbelievable. The headaches
get worse and worse.

163
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
I have an idea.

164
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,200
The President needs to
burn down this city

165
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,000
or flush it down a gigantic toilet.

166
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,770
"Taxi Driver"?

167
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,290
Exactly.

168
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

169
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,210
- You don't want anything?
- A coffee.

170
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,280
The coffee machine's broken.
Something else?

171
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,840
- A mineral water.
- Perfect.

172
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,370
Mh.

173
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
- Niko?
- Hm?

174
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
- Niko Fischer?
- Ja.

175
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,090
That's crude.

176
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,090
Julika. Julika Hoffmann.
We went to school together.

177
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

178
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,850
I was about three times
as fat then.

179
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,130
I called you Gay Julika, then.

180
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,120
- Julika.
- Yeah.

181
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,810
- Now.
- That's crude.

182
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,880
- That's eleven, twelve years...
- 13 years.

183
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,360
- Crazy. You look totally different.
- Yeah, thankfully.

184
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,010
- Sit down.
- I don't want to bother you.

185
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,400
- You're not bothering me. Sit down.
- No problem.

186
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,680
Thanks.

187
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,890
- That's Matzo.
- Hello.

188
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,530
- Hello.
- Oh.

189
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,410
- Crazy.
- Tell me everything!

190
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,560
- What're you doing? Are you studying?
- I'm, uh, yeah. I'm doing that.

191
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,960
Come one, tell me. How are you?

192
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,170
Have you noticed the time?

193
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,370
- I switched to a boarding school.
- Excactly, yeah.

194
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,010
It was a boarding school forâ¦
Overexcitable children.

195
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,890
But that was very helpful.

196
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,330
Yeah, that sounds very,
very good.

197
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,970
Yeah.

198
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,410
Oh man, I was so in love with you.
Despite all the humiliation.

199
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,120
- It's a difficult age.
- Totally.

200
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,970
- 13, 14.
- You cry the whole night.

201
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
You hate yourself.

202
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,410
I even tried to kill myself, once.

203
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,010
That's why my parents sent me
to boarding school.

204
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,610
It doesn't matter. Forget it.

205
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,530
- I have to go.
- Already?

206
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,650
Yeah. What're you doing tonight?

207
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,360
- We don't have anything big planned.
- A couple appointments. Why?

208
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,930
There's a performance of a play.
Are you interested in that kind of thing?

209
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,970
- Are you kidding? I'm an actor.

210
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,290
It doesn't matter. Think it over.
I'll reserve two tickets.

211
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,090
Okay. I'll check a couple times
to make sure we have a space free, OK?

212
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,450
- Eh, we'll come in any case.
- Really? Super.

213
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,650
Niko Fischer.

214
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,280
That's crude.

215
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
Gay Julika.

216
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,320
Here you go.

217
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,450
When does it start?

218
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,210
- Nine.
- Okay, I'll call you at 8:30.

219
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,930
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Of course it is. She's reserving tickets for us.

220
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,450
Hello?

221
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,970
Yes, I'll be right there.
I'm bringing someone with.

222
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
You're crazy.

223
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,850
A friend of mine.
He works right around the corner.

224
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,160
Will you drop me off at home?

225
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,890
There.

226
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,330
- Matze, man, that's awesome.
- Heil Hitler.

227
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,530
Now we'll Heil Hitler for real.
Come here, oldy.

228
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,040
- How are you?
- Super.

229
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,520
- My buddy Niko.
- Hallo, Niko. Philipp Rauch. Nice to meet you.

230
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,570
Folks, come in.

231
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,040
It's total chaos here.
You could clean up here.

232
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,680
- Should I close the door?
- Yeah.

233
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,320
- That thing is bigger than my apartment.
- Too big, yeah.

234
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,200
- That suit looks good on you.
- Put that out of your head.

235
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,360
The cut and the material,
it really looks good.

236
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,960
- Look look like my grandfather.
- Ah!

237
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,170
The game's over!
Come on, pants off.

238
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,850
Now, I'm going to cut
out your tongue.

239
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Heil Hitler.
That was a real matzo.

240
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,610
Yeah, for sure. Sit down.
Take the damn autograph cards away.

241
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,450
Are there perhaps a couple free,
untaken roles in it?

242
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,170
- Maybe something small. I'll ask.
- Only if it's not a problem.

243
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,170
No, it's fine.
I play the lead role there. You too?

244
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,330
Hm? No thanks.

245
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,250
- What? It's great.
- It's really not.

246
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,960
- Whoever doesn't want that, has it already.
- But are you allowed to say what it's about?

247
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
- What? In the film?
- Yeah, exactly.

248
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,400
- What's the story?
- That's a good question.

249
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,520
I play a sensible writer
who, before the war began,

250
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,560
was in love with a bookseller,
and didn't know, that she was a Jew.

251
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
During the war they
lose sight of each other.

252
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,920
And six years later,
I'm a faithful officer...

253
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,690
But not totally faithful.
There's a twist.

254
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,890
I'm in charge of searching through
Jewish houses.

255
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,250
There comes a moment,

256
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,210
in which, suddenly, Hanna,
the bookseller,

257
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,810
I see her again.

258
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,090
And now my character is
faced with this conflict.

259
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,250
To save her, not to save her?
What? How?

260
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,370
And in the final moment
he decides...

261
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,680
and he saves her from theâ¦
from the...

262
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,800
Deportation.

263
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,080
Thank you. Deportation.
He hides them.

264
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,210
The love breaks out again
and one night

265
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,170
she suddenly confesses to him...

266
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,330
Guess.

267
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,960
- That they've have a kid together?
- Jakob. Tiny, six years old.

268
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,530
And they have taken the child from her.

269
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,330
That is the moment for me,
for Heinrich,

270
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,920
in which something in him snaps.

271
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,850
He feels purified
and only wants the past to return.

272
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,210
He wants to see this child.

273
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Then comes something really dramatic.
But I won't tell you the end.

274
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,080
My god. Who thinks up this stuff?

275
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,530
- Is that based on true events?
- Yeah, it happened during the second world war.

276
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,690
Hey, Niko. Come over here.

277
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,290
Hey, come over here.
I'm gonna bite you. Come here.

278
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,930
Come, sit down.
You can take a look at the monitor.

279
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,570
Sit down.

280
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,410
How do I know you both?
Matze and you?

281
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,890
Because we were neighbors.

282
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,730
- Aha.
- Finished.

283
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,530
Thanks, Conny.

284
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,560
- And you?
- Hm?

285
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,250
- How do you know Matze?
- Theater school. It was ages ago.

286
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,920
If you really had a talent then,
then you enrolled there.

287
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,880
After a couple months
he had an audition.

288
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,520
I went by this door,
and through a crack I saw him perform.

289
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,130
People were flipping out!

290
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,970
A thousand offers.
TV, cinema, theater, everything.

291
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Those were really good times.

292
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,280
What happened?

293
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,840
Nothing. He cancelled everything,
thought it was all shit.

294
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,090
He sat in the bar and waited for
the right role. It never came.

295
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,520
Don't get me wrong --
I love this type.

296
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,920
A real actor
and a worthy man.

297
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,960
I know.

298
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,600
If you're going to speak about the devil.
Metze, come.

299
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,330
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

300
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,080
- And what did the boss say?
- Everything looks good.

301
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,090
- He'll call me again tomorrow.
- Don't worry, it'll go fine.

302
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,450
We're so far.

303
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
Folks, I have to.

304
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,570
Duty calls.

305
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
Don't run away.

306
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,960
- Quiet back there!
- Please be quiet and turn up the sound!

307
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,040
The sound is playing.

308
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Hanna. Hanna.

309
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,560
What?

310
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
What do you have?

311
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,530
Heinrich.

312
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
The war is over.

313
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,680
- What'd you say?
- You heard right.

314
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,970
Berlin is taken. People say that
Hitler has capitulated.

315
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,050
- But that means that we're free.
- No, you â¦ you are free, Hanna.

316
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,850
But tomorrow I have to hide.

317
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,730
- I'll tell them what you've done for me.
- You don't understand.

318
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,920
- You're not one of them.
- You don't know what I've done.

319
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,920
beautiful Hanna.

320
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,890
Farewell.

321
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,970
- Hello? One moment, one moment.
- Hello. Niko, I can hardly hear you.

322
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,410
- Niko.
- Now.

323
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,920
- Where are you? I can barely understand you.
- In the library.

324
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,130
- You can't call there.
- Then you're busy?

325
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,360
- So to speak.
- That's good, very good.

326
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,880
- You called.
- Exactly.

327
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,170
- I already tried last week.
- I'm sorry.

328
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,960
- Do you hear my messages?
- Sometimes.

329
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,130
If I never answered the telephone,
we'd be so tight.

330
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,650
This morning
my card was confiscated.

331
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,890
Really? I'm a half hour
away from your place.

332
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,880
Come by. We'll play and talk.

333
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,050
- Okay, I'll do that. If not...
- See you soon.

334
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,960
Fuck.

335
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,570
Kiss my ass,
that was at least 200 meters.

336
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,690
- If not 250, right?
- Ah. The champ is here.

337
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,730
Late as always, but he comes.

338
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,610
- Hello.
- What?

339
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,930
- How are you?
- Bad people are always doing fine.

340
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,130
Schneider, my new assistant.
Niki, my beloved son.

341
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,520
- Your own.
- You can't be so certain.

342
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice.

343
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,370
Come, help us
with a couple balls.

344
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,200
- I'm not sure if that's a good idea.
- Show off what you've got.

345
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,610
Good.

346
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,610
Weak, very weak.

347
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,090
You're standing wrong.
Stand 90 degrees from the direction of impact.

348
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,770
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

349
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,210
So?

350
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,530
Stupid kid,
don't bend your wrist.

351
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,240
Guide with your arm, hold the momentum,
and swing through with one movement.

352
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,210
Wonderful.
Schneider, hang them up.

353
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,890
Hello.

354
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,160
Yeah.

355
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,210
- Super.
- Two balls. Schneider against Niko.

356
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,010
The loser pays for the drinks.

357
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,370
150, good.

358
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
That was difficult.

359
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,680
Schneider, you look a little gay,
but it's efficient.

360
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,240
Imagine that you're standing over me
with the bat, OK?

361
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,160
And if that position feels right,
hold onto it.

362
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,370
What?

363
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,530
I'll get the drinks.
What'll it be?

364
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,040
- Coffee would be great.
- Not that. It's way too late for coffee.

365
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,440
- You need a schnapps.
- Isn't it a little early for that?

366
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
- We'll take three schnapps.
- Three schnaps.

367
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,330
Schneider is a good man.
He finished law school.

368
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
- Okay.
- Yeah.

369
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,250
A year younger than you.

370
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,090
And for you?

371
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,040
Also good. I think
that I'll be finished next year.

372
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,090
I'd love to consult you about it.

373
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
Gladly, anytime.

374
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,210
- What's your professor named?
- Hm...

375
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,840
- Do you mean Kollath?
- Dr. Kollath.

376
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,650
Very nice, very competent.

377
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
A good professor, yeah.

378
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,280
- Mm, because of the thing with the bank.
- Yeah.

379
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,610
- What was that?
- A vending machine took my card.

380
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,410
- Very, very strange.
- Odd.

381
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Yeah.

382
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,800
- It's for the best.
- You should be going.

383
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,250
- Excuse me?
- Schneider, please get the car.

384
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,530
- I had a great time.
- Mhm, likewise.

385
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,330
Yeah, what're we going to do about the Bank?

386
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,090
- Niko, why are you lying to me?
- Hm?

387
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,560
I met Pofessor Kollath at
a conference in Zurich.

388
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,120
He told me that you dropped out
of your studies two years ago.

389
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,810
My question, sweet Niko, is:

390
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,970
What have you done these last two years,
while I've been sending you money?

391
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Hm?

392
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,010
I've been thinking things over.

393
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,850
You've been thinking things over?

394
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,170
What things, might I ask?

395
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,370
Things about myself.

396
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,530
About yourself.

397
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,970
About everything.

398
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,690
I give you 1,000 euros,
so that you can think about yourself?

399
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Yeah.

400
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Get over it. When your mom
pushed you out, I was 24.

401
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,970
Then I had to make money.

402
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,360
I studied all day and
worked all night.

403
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,410
Because Niko wanted trumpet lessons.
And then he gave them up.

404
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,650
Niko gave up the Capoeira lessons.

405
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,010
Niko gave up fencing, guitar,
and piano lessons.

406
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,800
Why am I not surprised,
that you've given up your studies?

407
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
You're like your mother.

408
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,770
Don't you have anything to say?

409
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,730
Here.

410
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,730
Your account no longer exists.

411
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,290
Cut your hair,
buy normal shoes,

412
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
and get yourself a job.

413
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,360
What more can I do?
There's nothing more for you to do.

414
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,440
It's been great,
I had a great time.

415
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,160
- I need your ID.
- ID.

416
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,960
- The vending machine was broken.
- It may be. Your ID.

417
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,010
- In any case.
- Actually...

418
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,290
- ID, please.
- I have to buy a ticket.

419
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,360
But the vending machine was broken, right?

420
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,170
They've got to check and make sure
that these things function.

421
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,610
Sometimes a vending
machine is out of order.

422
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
No, please.

423
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,050
Then you can pick up a
ticket at the next station.

424
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,560
- For a legitimate ride.
- Legitimate.

425
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,010
- A ticket represents a contract.
- I'd love to have one, but I don't.

426
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,090
Use of a transportation system
without a valid ticket.

427
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,330
- Is 40 euros. Your information, please.
- That costs 40 euros.

428
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,930
Why do you repeat everything?

429
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,570
- I don't.
- You're like a robot.

430
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,610
- Your ID, please.
- ID.

431
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,320
- There it is again.
- 40 euros and your ID.

432
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,440
I'm going to call the police.
Hurry up.

433
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,890
- Please don't fight about the ID.
- You're repeating yourself.

434
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Good.

435
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,040
- So, you'd like to see my ID?
- For Christ's sake, yes.

436
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,240
- Why do you need to see my ID?
- We don't have to tell you that.

437
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
- Do you find this funny?
- Yes.

438
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,320
I don't have to state my name.
Only my badge number.

439
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,210
I have to identify myself
but you don't.

440
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,650
- Correct. Only the badge number.
- Let me guess... yours is R2-D2?

441
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,610
- Look out!
- Stefan! What's wrong with you today?

442
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,370
At some point you get a flat tire.

443
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,250
- Every day the same shit.
- I know. -Real quiet, yeah?

444
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,970
Stefan!

445
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,250
<i>-Freeze!
- Remain standing!</i>

446
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,810
- Stefan, I'm not fucking around.
- Stand back!

447
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,650
And chewing gum.
And a little vodka.

448
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,960
- One?
- What?

449
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,280
- One?
- Two.

450
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,290
Roman Hubnik bring the mood
into the booth.

451
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,760
The leader celebrates

452
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,160
and speaks
of Peitz's error.

453
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,690
Of course we have to go there.

454
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,330
I know.

455
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,850
Why'd you go straight there?

456
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,080
It's never a surprise.

457
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,400
- Yes?
- Good evening, Mrs. Baumann.

458
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,120
- Is Marcel home?
- Why do you ask?

459
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,720
- Marcel, is he home?
- Yes.

460
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,690
Who are you, then?

461
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,610
A friend of Marcel.

462
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,320
- Could you tell him that we're here?
- What do you want from him?

463
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,050
- Mrs. Baumann...
- Is coming. All's good, grandma.

464
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,730
Is coming.

465
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,250
Good evening.

466
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,280
- What can I offer you? Sneakers?
- No, we need something else.

467
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,760
- Okay, how many?
- Two.

468
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,610
Two. One moment.
I have to weigh it out.

469
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,130
- Marcel.
- Yes?

470
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,010
- Are your friends hungry?
- Hungry?

471
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
- No.
- You?

472
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,360
- Thank you.
- No.

473
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,330
- I can make some bread.
- No, but that's sweet. Maybe later.

474
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,330
Marcel, can I use
your toilet?

475
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,890
- You can lay one down right here.
- I need to.

476
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,000
- It's over there.
- Thanks.

477
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,400
What kind of
salamander is that?

478
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

479
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,400
I'm Niko, Matze's buddy.

480
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,370
I'm Mrs. Baumann,
Marcel's grandmother.

481
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,570
- Are you hungry?
- Hm? No, thank you.

482
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,120
- I can make some bread.
- That's sweet, but I'm not hungry.

483
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,600
- You've got a very chic chair.
- A gift from Marcel.

484
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,640
- Would you like to try it out?
- No, I don't want to disturb anyone.

485
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,810
And now lean yourself
back and relax.

486
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
- Like this?
- Yes, just like that.

487
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,280
Oh. What happens now?

488
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,970
Wow.

489
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,440
Yeah, that's good.

490
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,770
Niko.

491
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,880
Niko.

492
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,690
- Are you coming with or crashing here?
- I'm coming.

493
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,240
- You can crash here.
- We've got to go.

494
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,090
Ciao, have fun!

495
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,130
Take care of yoruself, Niko.

496
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,800
I will.

497
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,720
Hello.
There are tickets reserved under "Niko."

498
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,250
- You're quite late.
- We couldn't find parking.

499
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,930
That's unfortunate.
The show's already started.

500
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,210
What does taht mean?

501
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,730
That the show has already started.

502
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
There's nothing you can do?

503
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,960
- Who gave you the tickets?
- Julika.

504
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,570
Julika who?

505
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,090
Gay Julika...

506
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,690
"Gay Julika."

507
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,360
- Hoffmann.
- Julika Hoffmann, exactly.

508
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,610
Okay.

509
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,360
Third row.

510
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,690
Be quiet.
The show's already started.

511
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,130
Excuse me.

512
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,840
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

513
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,890
Ah!

514
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,730
Ah.

515
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,200
Ah.

516
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,250
Uh!

517
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,440
There you are!
We nearly began without you.

518
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,410
I brought someone with me.
Sabrina, Kerstin and Stella.

519
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,570
I went to boarding school
with Stella.

520
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,520
How sweet. Now we can begin.
I'm proud of you all. Cheers!

521
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,680
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

522
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,890
- Friends of yours?
- Yeah, Malta and Niko.

523
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,360
And that's Ralf, writer and director
of tonight's show.

524
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,960
Great performance.
Thank you so much.

525
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,530
- You liked it?
- Absolutely.

526
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,920
Then why did you laugh?

527
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
Hm?

528
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,850
Aren't you the two
that arrived late?

529
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,880
- What's wrong?
- You both laughed.

530
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,930
- That's not true.
- I heard you.

531
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,690
I was so sucked into the show
that I didn't notice.

532
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,680
Perhaps you don't like our art,
because it's "mainstream shit."

533
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,970
Why are you here then?

534
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,170
- Julika gave us tickets.
- Yeah.

535
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,400
It gets better and better.

536
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,160
- Ey.
- You got yourselves in free.

537
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,960
You don't have three euros for a ticket
and you laugh at us. Wonderful!

538
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,250
- Ralf.
- I hope, that you amused yourselves.

539
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,290
It wasn't really that bad.

540
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,210
There was just one passage
that I thought was supposed to be funny.

541
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,680
- Funny?
- He found it funny.

542
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,050
- You need to explain that better.
- What kind of vibe is that?

543
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,730
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- Wait, wait.

544
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,200
I'd like to know.
What did you find funny?

545
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,840
The representation of the birth.

546
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,010
That certainly entered
into the realm of the comic.

547
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,890
Then I asked myself,
with all seriousness,

548
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,440
why don't we come into the world
with a huge grin on our faces?

549
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,850
Why do we scream and cry
as we're being born?

550
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,450
To open up the
respiratory passage.

551
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,610
- Are you a doctor?
- No, but that's what I read.

552
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,210
- What makes you an authority?
- Nothing.

553
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,760
- Nothing?
- I didn't laugh.

554
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,080
- And you?
- I work in ... well, in advertising.

555
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,290
- You're an actor.
- Very interesting.

556
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,760
- Let me guess. City theater? National?
- No. That's nonsense.

557
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,610
- So not a subsidized group, then.
- No.

558
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,690
- Film? "The Berlin School"?
- I don't have anything against your play.

559
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,560
Why is it so wrong, if we bring
a little fresh air into the official scene?

560
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,250
- What?
- That's absolutely praiseworthy.

561
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,090
- Praiseworthy?
- Yeah.

562
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,610
- That's an old friend.
- What does "your guests" mean here?

563
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,130
- It's not your problem.
- You get paid 2,000 euros.

564
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,360
For eight weeks.

565
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,320
- Excuse me, do you have a light?
- Yeah.

566
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,000
Thanks.

567
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,040
Thanks.

568
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,730
Hey, that's something.

569
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,970
Uh!

570
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Hello.

571
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,840
Hold up, man! You pissed yourself!

572
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,090
Hey.

573
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,370
- Hi.
- I was worried that you'd left.

574
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,720
I wanted to have a smoke,
before I totally ruin the party.

575
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,200
Nonsense.
You haven't ruined the party.

576
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,600
- Ralf feels otherwise.
- Ach, Ralf. He needs to relax.

577
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,930
He's so obsessed
with his work.

578
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,210
That's true.

579
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,770
But I really don't think what he makes
is very good.

580
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,090
- What do you care, then?
- Because it's my hobby.

581
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,080
I love it, when I stand on the stage
and everyone is watching me.

582
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,850
When you bare yourself to strangers,
that is the best sort of danger.

583
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,730
Others find it
quite embarassing.

584
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
I don't find it embarassing.

585
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,450
I liked it.

586
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,760
- You're lying.
- No, honestly. I found it...

587
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,440
I thought it was brave of you.

588
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,600
Yeah.

589
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,810
I wouldn't trust that myself.

590
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,730
- You didn't used to be so reticent.
- When was that?

591
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,880
If was if you knew exactly
what you wanted.

592
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,810
What was that?

593
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
I don't know.

594
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,720
Do you know what it's like,

595
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,210
to have the feeling that

596
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,890
that all the people around you
are honeslty kind of weird?

597
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,730
But when you think it over,

598
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,400
then it becomes clear
that the problem is with yourself.

599
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,370
Excuse me. I don't want to disturb.

600
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,640
- But you don't have a cig.
- I don't smoke.

601
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,570
Oh. Here.

602
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,090
Thank you, thank you.
Do you have one for my buddy too? Thanks.

603
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,370
- Take one yourself.
- How proper of you.

604
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,610
- You're not from Berlin?
- We are, but we'd like to chat again.

605
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,920
Kein Problem. Warte mal.
Kommt mal her, ihr Spasten.

606
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,170
I thought you were Kevin.
He's got something on his mind.

607
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,920
- Now you can ask.
- Fuck that.

608
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,000
- Chill, man.
- Control yourself, man.

609
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,000
I'll give you 10 euros,
if you show me your tits.

610
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,440
Very funny.

611
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,850
- Hey, don't you want to have fun?
- It's a great offer.

612
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,530
Are you frigid or what?

613
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,090
Julika, it doesn't matter.

614
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,680
- How old are you? 17, 18?
- None of your business.

615
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,850
You've got to let your cock get hard
before you make the ladies mad.

616
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,800
- Hey! Good precaution!
- What kind of person are you?

617
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,650
Julika, let us...

618
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,370
Let me guess,
you came into the world as an alcoholic,

619
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,800
becuase your pregnant mother
was wasted on schnapps.

620
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,650
And your father beat you,
when he came out of the bar.

621
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,650
- Hold the presses!
- Then he didn't even come around.

622
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,360
And your mother blamed you,
and now you think the world is shit,

623
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,440
and now you run around with your gang
and play the leader.

624
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,170
But all you really want
is for someone to take you in their arms.

625
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,640
- Don't let yourself offer that.
- Exactly, don't offer that.

626
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,530
- Shut your mouth, you whore.
- Whore?

627
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,320
- Should we go inside?
- That whore will let you in for sure.

628
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,290
- And she'll let you call her "Mama."
- I'll shut your mouth.

629
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,920
- Hey.
- Hands off, you victim.

630
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,610
- You're the victim.
- I'll fuck you!

631
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,610
- Are you going home now?
- What, man!

632
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,210
- You're dead! You're dead, man!
- Come on.

633
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,890
Whore!

634
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,930
Little wanker.
We should call the police.

635
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,610
Nonsense.
They just want to take a walk...

636
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,170
Does it hurt a lot?

637
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,600
No.

638
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,120
- Did I look pathetic when I fell down?
- Not at all.

639
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,600
Okay.

640
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,360
Maybe a little.

641
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:50,130
No. You stepped in between them, man.
That's the only thing that counts.

642
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,400
It's because you provoked them,
that it went so far.

643
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,970
What do you mean by that?

644
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,240
You'd already done plenty
to piss them off.

645
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,210
You should ignore them
and just keep going.

646
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,570
Everyone knows that.

647
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:10,570
Do you know how many times I've tried
to ignore these comments?

648
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,210
Your comments.

649
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,160
Do you know how it feels
when you weigh 80 kilos as a child

650
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,640
and everyone calls you
"Gay Julika"?

651
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,090
and "elephant girl" and...

652
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,280
- Dish rag.
- Dish rag.

653
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,970
- Do you know how that feels?
- Of course not.

654
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,040
You feel a little like shit.

655
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,200
It took a long time
for me to get over it.

656
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,680
That's why I don't ignore it anymore.

657
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,130
Absolutely not.

658
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,570
I'm sorry.

659
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,280
Thanks.

660
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,570
You really look great.

661
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,730
Really?

662
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,250
Absolutely.

663
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,050
But deep in my heart
I'm not the same.

664
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,370
That fat little...

665
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,640
depressed girl.

666
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,920
What do you mean?

667
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,600
Would you like
to fuck that little fat girl?

668
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,250
Um...

669
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,320
Say it. That you want to fuck
the little fat girl.

670
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,410
- Say it, or...
- Yeah, say it.

671
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,640
You want to fuck
the little fat girl.

672
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,930
- I want to fuck the little fat...
- Yeah, say it. Fuck the fat girl.

673
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,050
- The little fat girl, I want...
- Louder.

674
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,920
- The little fat girl, you want to...
- Stop. Stop. Julika, wait. Stop.

675
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,130
- What?
- Please. I, I...

676
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,330
- We shouldn't do that.
- Why?

677
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,080
Am I too fat for you?

678
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,210
No, not at all.

679
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,890
I just mean, man,
that feels a little strange.

680
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,890
Do you really think I'm too fat?

681
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,080
What?

682
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,160
Okay, Julika.

683
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,130
Fuck off.

684
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,000
All that I want to say is,

685
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,170
yeah, it honestly, for me,
feels a little strange.

686
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,360
Yeah? So if after so many years,
we were to,

687
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,610
in the same way as anyone else,

688
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,890
dealing with the past...

689
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,360
- What? Dealing with the past?
- Yeah, the past.

690
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,120
What kind of pathetic person
are you, really? Hm?

691
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,330
Should we maybe go get a drink?

692
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,400
Stay away!
Everyone wants to fuck me. Get out of here.

693
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,370
I'm done with you. Go quickly.
I'm going to get hysterical soon. Go.

694
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,930
Okay.

695
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,800
Julika...

696
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,450
I told you --
You can go piss yourself.

697
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,690
- Hello.
- Hello. Do you still have coffee?

698
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,770
Not any more, no.
The machine has already been cleaned.

699
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,610
- A vodka and a beer then, okay?
- Gladly.

700
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,090
Are you a lonely wolf?

701
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,050
Can we get two more here?

702
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,600
I don't understand people anymore.

703
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,570
I don't understand a single word,
that they all say.

704
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,370
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be left alone.

705
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:36,890
I don't have the faintest idea
what you're actually talking about.

706
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,810
Do you understand what I mean?

707
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,850
No...

708
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,280
Listen to me. It sounds
like another language, right?

709
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,410
- They speak German.
- Oh, they speak German?

710
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,730
- Yeah, most of them.
- Yup.

711
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,280
- So I should be able to understand them.
- Yes.

712
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,080
Ah. Don't I also speak German?

713
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,970
- But?
- But actually, yeah, I do.

714
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,280
Yes, no? Actually, yes.

715
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,250
Cheers, my friend.

716
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,690
Cheers.

717
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,970
- You're not from here, are you?
- Why do you ask?

718
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,520
Kid, of course I'm from here!

719
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,930
I was just away for a little bit.

720
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,970
60 years.

721
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,680
You were just a sparkle
in the eye of a sailor, right?

722
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,840
- And where were you for 60 years?
- Away.

723
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,640
Aha.

724
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,330
And now I'm back.

725
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,410
I understand.

726
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,360
You don't understand.
You don't understand anything.

727
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,240
Everything looked very
different here, my friend.

728
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,450
Over there was my school.
I was so dirty.

729
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,290
We pissed our pants,

730
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,520
because we had to stand at attention
at the front of the class

731
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:37,130
and greet the FÃ¼hrer:
"Heil Hitler" here, "heil Hilter," there.

732
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,200
- Hey, hey!
- It's OK.

733
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,010
You can't really understand it,
when you're that old.

734
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,930
What do you do, then?
You do what everyone does.

735
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,050
It's always been nice here, right?

736
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,450
Or are you of the other opinion?
Yeah? Are you of the other opinion?

737
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,250
Perhaps from today's perspective...

738
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,560
Yeah. From today's perspective...

739
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:09,010
Ha! My dear friend,"from
today's perspective" meant nothing then.

740
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:13,050
From today's perspective.
I was away for sixty years.

741
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,520
I can't honestly remember.

742
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,720
Over there, where the parking lot is,
that was once a playing field.

743
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,600
My gang used to hang out there
the whole afternoon.

744
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,080
I was the littlest and had to play goal.
Yeah, so it went.

745
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,120
In front of here my old man
taught me to ride a bike.

746
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,330
I tell you, I don't know,

747
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,290
how often I fell
on my face out there.

748
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,040
But he never stopped.
We always continued.

749
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:49,450
Suddenly one day I was able
to ride a long way by myself.

750
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,810
It was good, that the bike was perhaps
a little too big for me.

751
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,970
People always laughed about
how proud I was about my long ride.

752
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,090
"Don't let them laugh at you",

753
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,810
my father told me.

754
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,770
But I never really had the feeling
that they were laughing at me.

755
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,280
I had the feeling,

756
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,680
that they were happy.

757
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,690
And then when they were gone?

758
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,160
Once in the middle of the night
my father woke me up and said:

759
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:43,050
"Come with me, child, onto the street.
I want to show you something."

760
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,240
So then I was with him in the street.

761
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:54,410
He put a couple stones
in my hand and said:

762
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,050
"Now look at what you have there."

763
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,810
Then he took a
a stone himself

764
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,890
and broke these panes of glass with it.

765
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,000
Yeah. Right here, where we're sitting.

766
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,010
The street was full of people.

767
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,600
It was pitch black.

768
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,240
Not so bright as today,
where eveything's lit up and shining,

769
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,410
because people
can't bear the darkness anymore.

770
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,090
Pitch black.

771
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,690
And all these people
were breaking windows with stones.

772
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,370
And these windowpanes here, my father

773
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,890
quickly smashed into pieces.

774
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,930
And I stood over there on the street.

775
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,960
and everything was full of broken glass,

776
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,090
and it burned and
the street glittered

777
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,640
because the fire was so bright.

778
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,930
And I can still remember perfectly,

779
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,400
that at some point I started to cry.

780
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,840
And now you ask, why?

781
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,010
Why?

782
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,160
Becuase I thought:

783
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,690
"Because of all these glass shards,
I can't ride my bike here anymore."

784
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,920
- Hey, hey, hey. Is everying OK?
- What?

785
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,970
- Is everything OK with you?
- I can't understand you.

786
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,760
- Call an ambulance, please.
- Yeah.

787
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,090
- Another unit.
- Access isn't clear.

788
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,720
- Other side.
- Heartbeat?

789
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,530
It doesn't look good.

790
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,600
- They can't come in.
- But how's he doing?

791
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,810
- Are you relatives?
- No.

792
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,960
Please take a seat in the waiting room.

793
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,960
Excuse me, do you have a light?

794
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,400
Is he doing better?

795
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,680
He's dead.

796
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,560
I'm sorry.

797
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,240
Hm.

798
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,690
- Have you called his family?
- He doesn't have one.

799
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,890
No one?

800
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,240
Can you tell me what his name is?

801
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,210
I can't, actually.

802
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,680
The first name?

803
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,610
Friedrich.
