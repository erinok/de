1
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:48,785
Hey! Come on,
Mouse, out of the water!

2
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:53,937
Oh, Mama. A little longer.
- I said out! Right now!

3
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,261
You're both completely blue!

4
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,266
They're pretty.
- Who are they?

5
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:14,461
The Shah of Iran and his wife.
- Ah, my three Graces.

6
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:18,547
Papa, what is a Shah?
- Sort of like a king.

7
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:22,946
A Shah may cut off the
head of anyone he dislikes.

8
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:27,141
Don't tell the children such rubbish.
- The Truth is Simple.

9
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:31,147
With such power, there is no joke.
- Hallo, Klaus.

10
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:35,102
And? How goes the Revolution?
- Right now, it's on holiday.

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,898
Will you to come to our party tonight?
- Certainly.

12
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,064
Well, until then.
- Yes.

13
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:54,065
Ah, Klaus, not now.

14
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,817
Yeah, sure, OK.
- It makes me nervous.

15
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:01,782
Yes, but not very much.
So cheer up.

16
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:05,586
The royal couple landed at 11.05...

17
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,707
in a private plane
at Tempelhof airport.

18
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:14,419
Empress Farah wore a fox-fur coat
and a black and white hat.

19
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,300
Stefan!

20
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,257
Stefan!

21
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:22,706
The Shah inspected an
honour-guard of the Berlin Police.

22
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:38,028
Stefan, dear friend.

23
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,346
Fresh off the presses.

24
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,742
OK.

25
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,458
For all to hear.

26
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,580
My clever star-journalist wife...

27
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:57,224
wrote an open letter
to her imperial highness Farah Diba.

28
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:02,786
Don't make a big deal of it.
- It'll be in the next edition.

29
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:08,422
5000 of these fliers are
already at the universities.

30
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,300
Very good.

31
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:15,704
Good day, Mrs Pahlevi. There's a story
in the New Review about life in Iran,

32
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:20,979
about how hot it gets there,
and how you, like most Persians,

33
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:24,657
like to holiday on the Caspian coast.

34
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,782
Like most Persians?
Isn't that an exaggeration?

35
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:33,698
Most Persians are farmers,
and make less than 100 Marks a year.

36
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:37,980
And half of all Persian
mothers die giving birth.

37
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,465
From hunger, poverty and illness.

38
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,627
And the children work
14-hour days weaving carpets.

39
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:50,305
Do most of them really holiday
with you at the Caspian seaside?

40
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:54,467
They write:
"The Shah must have a son. "

41
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,627
Iranian Law is
very strict on that point.

42
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:02,946
Strange that it seems so
unimportant to the Shah.

43
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:07,027
And no official statement is made.

44
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:11,187
That the Minister of Justice
makes no comment.

45
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:15,501
That unofficial courts
are held in secret.

46
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:19,587
That torture is allowed
under Persian law.

47
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,824
We do not want to insult you.

48
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:26,100
But the German public
should not be insulted

49
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,265
with crap like this
story in the New Review.

50
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:32,346
Faithfully,
Ulrike Meinhof.

51
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:56,497
Welcome, Pahlevi!
- Princess, Princess!

52
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,502
Farah! Farah Diba!

53
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,061
Murderer!

54
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,984
Are they crazy?

55
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:43,657
Murderer!

56
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:51,467
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

57
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,506
Don't push me, you wanker!

58
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:01,261
Stop!

59
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:08,982
Is there a doctor here?
Let us through!

60
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:13,426
It's out of control here.
Are you stupid? There, the woman!

61
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:17,507
Can you help us?
We have an injured person here.

62
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,464
What happened?

63
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:47,297
He was attacking me.
- You are mad?

64
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,708
Let's go.

65
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,501
He needs a physician!

66
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:16,462
Mrs Meinhof, they were not on
the demonstrators' side. Why?

67
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:23,659
The right-wing press blamed
the disaster on the students.

68
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:28,427
Above all the Springer group
tried, in its newspaper,

69
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:33,025
to label the students as rioters.

70
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:38,427
"To shout is no longer enough,
now they want blood. "

71
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,539
But the truth is,

72
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:44,866
the protest proved that
we live in a Police state.

73
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:49,937
That the Police and the press
went too far in Berlin on June 2nd.

74
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:54,220
And that the only freedom
here is for the Police.

75
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:58,136
But Mrs Meinhof, with all respect...
- We all know that Kurras...

76
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:02,227
...who shot Ohnesorg, will be acquitted.

77
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:06,427
That is pure demagogy!
That is demagogy.

78
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:10,741
In America they discuss using
nuclear weapons in Vietnam,

79
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:14,907
and Israel starts a war of
aggression with the help of the USA.

80
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,067
which is called "preventive war" here.
- Israel has to defend itself.

81
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:24,342
Then Hitler's attacks on Poland
and Russia were also "preventive".

82
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:29,901
But you can't say that!
- Mrs Meinhof, I must say...

83
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,418
You must also consider the child.

84
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:36,699
This woman has nothing worthwhile to say.

85
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:40,787
The American Imperialist
machine will not stop!

86
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,384
Vietnam, Bolivia and now the Near East.

87
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:48,422
America has supplied
Israel with weapons for years.

88
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:52,821
Each warplane, each rocket,
each tank, everything comes from the USA.

89
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,260
Or the western industrial nations.
- They are not the people's friends!

90
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,427
The pigs want to control the
oil fields of the Near East.

91
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:05,587
It's just shit to them if
many thousands of people die.

92
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,667
I must now go to church.
- You should preach...

93
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:13,941
that over half the people in the world
do not have enough to eat.

94
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:18,027
Is it senseless to
preach for a better world?

95
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,337
That those condemned once again must resist!

96
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,821
You should get married soon.

97
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,938
Ulrike! Wait!

98
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:09,501
Wait!

99
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,344
Finally.

100
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,661
Hello, Baby.
- Well, Kitty?

101
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:40,502
So, here it is.
I hope it's enough.

102
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:54,026
Will it be enough?
- Why?

103
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,864
So...
- Hey!

104
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,467
I think... we don't want to
torch the department store

105
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:08,706
We need hard action to show
that wanker that we're not kidding!

106
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,219
And if people are still inside?
- Don't talk like a homo, Tussi.

107
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:18,058
Who'd be there at night?
And if there is: a bigger headline!

108
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:22,500
Are you insane?
- Andreas knows what he's doing.

109
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,666
You're under arrest!
- Police! Halt!

110
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,099
Idiot!
- Police!

111
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:52,938
Handcuff them!
- You're under arrest for arson.

112
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,740
Good morning.

113
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:01,620
Under continuous bombardment
by American warplanes...

114
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:06,822
of alleged Vietcong positions,
civilian populations suffer the most.

115
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,066
In the USA, particularly at
universities, these pictures led...

116
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,261
the students to rise up in protest.
In the Federal Republic...

117
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:19,586
thousands of students protest,
such as these, in Berlin.

118
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,463
The Anarchist Rudi Dutschke
mobilizes the resistance.

119
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:27,945
Comrades, we don't have much time.

120
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:33,745
In Vietnam the bombs fall every day.
We must stand up for them.

121
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:39,462
As Che said: It is not a matter of
wishing success to the victim of aggression,

122
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:43,137
but of sharing his fate.

123
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:47,659
One must accompany him
to his death or to victory.

124
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:57,022
From German ground...

125
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:01,107
From German ground
wars are still prepared.

126
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,425
From German ports and miltary bases...

127
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:10,305
The American military
wages the Vietnam war!

128
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,941
We cannot allow this!

129
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:20,340
We must stop the German government

130
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:25,462
helping this Imperialist war in Viet Nam!

131
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,106
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?
- Yes.

132
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,142
We are forced to take illegal action...

133
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,426
let sabotage and blockades start now!

134
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,946
We protest against this conference!

135
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:55,387
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this conference is terminated!

136
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,621
Are you Rudi Dutschke?

137
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:14,702
Yes, I am.
- You dirty communist pig!

138
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:47,186
I am dead. Let me live.

139
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:00,386
Father. Mother.

140
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:04,736
Soldier... Soldier...

141
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,417
He's down here!
He went down here somewhere.

142
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:21,626
Search the building site.
- Covering!

143
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,787
You are surrounded!
Come out with hands up!

144
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,662
I can't stand communists.

145
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:54,381
Rudi Dutschke is in critical condition
after two hours of emergency surgery today.

146
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:58,581
Only one of the two bullets
could be removed from his head.

147
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:03,782
Spontaneous demonstrations
have sprung up across the country,

148
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,867
blaming the Springer publishing house
for inciting the assasination attempt.

149
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,584
Springer, Murderer!

150
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:46,387
I didn't think this was your style!

151
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:04,386
Attention, this is the Police!

152
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:08,867
You are trespassing
on private property.

153
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,986
Leave the area immediately!

154
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:14,901
Come along!

155
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:23,983
Frau Meinhof? What are you doing here?
Release her. Frau Meinhof is a journalist.

156
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,704
Dresden!

157
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,580
Hiroshima!

158
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:34,100
Vietnam!

159
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,860
Dresden!

160
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,540
Hiroshima!

161
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,100
Vietnam!

162
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,426
Che Guevara was captured...

163
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:57,224
and then murdered by the CIA...

164
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,867
Yesterday Martin Luther King
was assasinated...

165
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,145
...Senator Robert Kennedy was shot...

166
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:10,341
Republican Richard Nixon becomes
the 37th President of the USA

167
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:15,019
Soldiers sealed off the street
and fired into the crowd.

168
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,100
One of the first Soviet vehicles
into Czechoslovakia...

169
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:24,506
The students call the protests
in Paris cultural revolution.

170
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,540
The state calls it anarchy.

171
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,781
The more I hear of this shouting,

172
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:35,867
the clearer it becomes - we need
to ensure the rule of law in this country.

173
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,063
In agreement with Andreas Baader
I want to make a statement.

174
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:44,978
He and I placed the bomb
in the department store.

175
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:50,580
We did it to protest
against the indifference...

176
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:54,827
of people who sit and watch
the genocide in Vietnam.

177
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:05,580
We believe that speech
without action is wrong.

178
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,581
Order, please!

179
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,868
Order, please!

180
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,860
Mr Mahler?

181
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,982
Could you do us the honour of
allowing the court to share the joke?

182
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:30,102
The judges can hardly understand
the ideas Ms Ensslins and Mr Baader.

183
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:35,256
Otherwise they would take off their
robes and join the protests themselves.

184
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,946
Order!

185
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,108
Order, please!

186
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:47,502
Mr Ensslin, your daughter wanted to
address your generation with her act.

187
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,666
Whatever they wanted to do,
it comes to this:

188
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:56,738
Our generation experienced,
in the name of the people,

189
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:01,027
concentration camps, Jew hate, genocide,

190
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:06,057
and now will not permit
reformation, a new beginning.

191
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:12,700
How do you explain that,
with the world as it is?

192
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:18,221
It's amazing that Gudrun, who considers
things very rationally and intelligently,

193
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,961
by one foolish act, experienced

194
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:28,426
a holy self implementation.

195
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:32,627
I feel that she created
something free with her act.

196
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:36,787
Even in the family.
I feel liberated.

197
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:41,459
Of a tightness and a fear,
that had ruled my life before.

198
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,666
It took the fear from me.

199
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:54,627
<i>Throw a single stone,
and that is a crime.</i>

200
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:59,419
<i>Throw a thousand stones
and that is a political action.</i>

201
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:03,583
<i>Set fire to a car,
that is a crime.</i>

202
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:08,862
<i>Burn a thousand cars,
and that is a political act.</i>

203
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:14,947
<i>Protest is saying:
"I disagree with this and that. "</i>

204
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:18,506
<i>Resistance is saying:</i>

205
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:22,627
<i>"I will put a stop to this and that. "</i>

206
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:31,145
Thanks for making this possible.
- It's OK. I've read your work.

207
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,776
Can one stop the genocide in Vietnam by
burning down a department store?

208
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:46,982
No. It was an error,
as I said in court.

209
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:53,185
It was an act of rebellion.
But it was pointless...

210
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,266
while Fascism grows
as strong as it was under Hitler.

211
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:01,542
This time we offer resistance.
Out of responsibility before history.

212
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:06,777
People, here and in America,
must eat. Must eat and buy.

213
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:13,298
But they do not think
about it, they just consume.

214
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:18,147
We wanted them to
think about it a little.

215
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:21,340
So you burned down
a department store?

216
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:25,541
I will never resign myself
to doing nothing. Never.

217
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:28,978
If people try to murder us,
like Ohnesorg und Dutschke,

218
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:33,659
then we will shoot back.
That is only consistent.

219
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:37,061
Do you really mean that?

220
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:41,938
All over the world
comrades fight with guns in hand.

221
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:46,027
We must become soldiers.
- We fight already.

222
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:50,187
And if the fascists throw
you into prison for it?

223
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,266
Such victims they'll have.

224
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:58,826
Or do you believe that you'll change
something with your grand theory?

225
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:05,866
Sorry, I didn't mean to be cruel.

226
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:29,182
Is Baader or Gudrun here?
- Gudrun is up there.

227
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:41,027
Oh! Sorry!
- Hello. Who are you?

228
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:46,297
I'm Peter Boock.
- And I'm Gudrun.

229
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,388
Are you a runaway?

230
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,546
Youth Training Centre.
- There are others here, too.

231
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:56,707
They'll soon come and join us.
They gather up here.

232
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:02,147
Can I bathe afterwards?
- Bathe now.

233
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:06,827
No water wasting here.
Tell me about yourself.

234
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:18,147
Where did you get that?
- Youth Training Centre. Lucky City.

235
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:35,827
I heard about it.
You nearly burned the place down.

236
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:39,982
The bastards nearly
beat us to death for it.

237
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:45,226
If they catch me,
no more day leave till I turn 21.

238
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:49,261
Don't let it worry you.
You're part of our family now.

239
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:53,745
You were locked up for arson, too.

240
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:56,826
But we are free on appeal.

241
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:01,067
And at least we can make an appeal.

242
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:04,385
And so we make it.
- And if they find me?

243
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:09,457
Andreas and I must disappear,
if our appeal is rejected.

244
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:19,347
Tell me... do I see right?
You trying to fuck my old lady?

245
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:30,784
Well, Kitty?

246
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:33,781
Hey.

247
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,341
Andreas, this is Peter.

248
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:48,062
What happened to you?
- The staff at Lucky City.

249
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,945
Then we should tear them some new arseholes.

250
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,628
Great leather jacket!

251
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,263
Here, it's yours.

252
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:05,144
Let's go! To Darmstadt!
- We don't have enough cars.

253
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,544
Then we'll steal two or three.

254
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:50,146
Only the gun cures the rigidity.

255
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:57,028
Go on, fire at will!

256
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,424
Fire at will!

257
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:18,102
We have made
extraordinary efforts...

258
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:24,258
to understand what the people want.
We want more democracy.

259
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:28,740
These words of the new Federal Chancellor
Willy Brandt as he takes office...

260
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:33,783
reconcile the students and end
nearly 3 years continuous riots.

261
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:38,823
The reform promises to create
peace at the universities, and the basis

262
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:43,817
to bring the outside parliamentary
opposition into the democratic process.

263
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,907
And what do you believe?
- I think the worst is over.

264
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:52,903
The protest movement
has lost its momentum.

265
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:58,102
Groups which feel existentially oppressed

266
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,788
will not hesitate

267
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:07,378
to bomb whatever parts of
society they see as oppressive.

268
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,906
Over here!
Can't you see us?

269
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:22,581
Gudrun?

270
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:27,018
Andreas... Hallo, Astrid.
- Mister Counsellor.

271
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:33,827
And? What are your plans?
What's next for you?

272
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:38,261
Can't you talk normally? Do you
really think Interpol are after us?

273
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:42,097
...because those jerks
in Frankfurt rejected our appeal?

274
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,981
We're not going back to prison.

275
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:49,221
Then come to Berlin. Illegally.
We're building up a new group.

276
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:54,422
We're further along than you'd think.
What have your guys done?

277
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:58,587
A lot's happened since you've been away.
We have good contacts.

278
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,781
Houses, ID, money, weapons.
We can provide everything.

279
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:07,663
Yeah, under your leadership.
The illegal underground attorney.

280
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:11,747
I'm shitting myself.
- Let him finish.

281
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,943
They couldn't steal grandma's puppy!
- That's not the point.

282
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:20,140
Where's Dutschke now?
- Living in London.

283
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:23,624
He's crippled, can hardly speak.

284
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:28,020
Since he was shot, nobody leads
while the struggle goes on.

285
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:33,302
The struggle would have been won,
if they hadn't screwed it up.

286
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:39,258
Show us what you're made of.
Steal the purse from granny's bag.

287
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,937
Baby...
- I want to know if he's got the balls.

288
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:48,346
Or is it all just talk?

289
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,380
Oh, man!

290
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:20,662
Fucking shit, they're stealing my car!

291
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:24,747
Hey! Stop!
Fucking spagetti-muncher!

292
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:30,182
Shit! You dumb bitch,
you left the car open again!

293
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:34,267
So what? Steal a new one.
- You CUNT!

294
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:37,181
CUNT! FUCK IT ALL!

295
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,501
WHY?

296
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:50,586
What are you doing here? Why us?

297
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:53,941
So call the cops.

298
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,707
Where's Ulrike?
- In bed.

299
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,786
Where's the bedroom?
- Back there.

300
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:04,941
Wait a minute.

301
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,986
Quiet, you'll wake the children.

302
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,588
We're back.

303
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:41,985
They're hunting you, you know.
- Big deal.

304
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:45,657
Can we stay here for a while?
- Yes, of course.

305
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:50,467
We're recruiting here
in Berlin. And in other cities.

306
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:54,741
We're expanding the group.
Political conditions change.

307
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,827
What are your plans?
- What kind of stupid question is that?

308
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,057
We take action.
If it goes wrong, too bad.

309
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:11,782
So, that's it for me.
Where can I crash?

310
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:18,140
I'll join you in a moment.

311
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,787
What does he mean, though?
- He means exactly what he said.

312
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:26,947
Andreas does not compromise.
You must understand that.

313
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,107
Andreas is more of a revolutionary
than all the rest of us together.

314
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:34,141
Sounds great when you're stoned.

315
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:38,866
You look unhappy.

316
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:44,016
I saw a film about Youth Homes.
Girls there are treated like shit.

317
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:50,064
I thought I could do something
about it, but they remain shitty.

318
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:53,701
But Peggy there escaped.

319
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,426
What we need is a new morality.

320
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:00,626
You must see that clearly.

321
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:04,702
Draw a line between you and our enemies.

322
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:10,141
You must leave the system
and burn your bridges.

323
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:15,422
And your son?
That you may never see again?

324
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,698
If you're serious,
you have to be prepared to suffer.

325
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,586
Andreas also has a baby daughter.

326
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,946
I could never leave my children.

327
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,061
Shit.

328
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:18,219
Do you know how fast you were going?
- No. Do you?

329
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:21,861
Show me your license, please.

330
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,986
And the registration papers, please.

331
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,026
I'm sorry about this, officer.

332
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:40,062
My friend seems to have thrown them out.

333
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,586
You live in Rome, Mr Hoger?
- Yes.

334
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:51,457
Your date of birth?
- 14/6 nineteen...

335
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:54,786
'39.

336
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:59,665
You don't seem too sure about it.
- It was a long time ago.

337
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:05,627
And?

338
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,706
They're holding him in Moabit jail.

339
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,777
We have to get him out.
- I'll help.

340
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,664
Me too.

341
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:20,061
How? Tying sheets together?

342
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:25,336
You can write about it afterwards.
That's all you're good for.

343
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:29,507
Perhaps Andreas should
just serve the ten months.

344
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:34,941
Shit! Freeing Prisoners is
what we're always talking about.

345
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:40,096
We'll show the pigs what we can do,
if they lock up our people.

346
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:43,061
We're getting Andy out! Now!

347
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:49,537
We can't visit him in prison anyway.

348
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:55,708
You'll be a publisher.
We'll get in with a book contract.

349
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,261
Good day.

350
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:08,667
This is Dr Gretel Weitemeier,
who will be publishing our book.

351
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:12,747
Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

352
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,188
Are you insane?

353
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:28,187
Man, it only fires tear gas.
Looks real though, eh?

354
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,186
Where did you get that?
- from Gudrun.

355
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:40,542
We've got a lot of things, now.
- And who is "we"?

356
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,628
I cannot say.

357
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:50,027
Well, I can:
Gudrun, Astrid, Ingrid.

358
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,826
I bought some Asprin.
- Ulrike.

359
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:56,861
She's only the decoy.

360
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,586
You told me you
wouldn't be involved!

361
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,946
What is your part? Well?

362
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:10,067
Mahler arranged for Andreas and I
to visit the Sociological Institute...

363
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:14,261
to research our book.
- They're allowing him out for that?

364
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:18,347
With a Police escort, of course.
- That's where we come in.

365
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:22,939
Inside the Institute,
we stick guns in the cops' faces...

366
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:26,026
and away runs Baader.
- And you?

367
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:29,300
I stand back and look surprised. That's all.

368
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:32,386
Now can we get on with dinner?

369
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:38,496
But you're all female.
What if they don't take you seriously?

370
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:43,656
Mahler knows some professionals.
We'll have help. Mahler says...

371
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:47,827
it'll be a piece of cake.
- I don't believe it.

372
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:51,907
The cops have real guns,
not like that piece of junk.

373
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:57,181
This is completely insane!

374
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:00,581
I have to go through with it.

375
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:25,062
Mr Baader, in the event of an
escape attempt, we are authorised to shoot.

376
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:29,625
I want to make sure you know that.
- You needn't worry about it.

377
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:47,983
I've seen you on TV.
- Hopefully I was interesting.

378
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:52,499
Yes, very. Anything else you need?
- Thanks, I'll manage.

379
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,578
Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:41:07,228 --> 00:41:09,788
Sit down here.

381
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:14,337
Can I get a cup of coffee?
- Of course.

382
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:24,503
Are you married? Do you have any children?
- Yes, wife and child.

383
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:36,457
So, moving along. We have...

384
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,545
I told you yesterday,
come back after noon today.

385
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:48,423
The reading room is occupied.
- Then we'll wait here.

386
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,506
It's a long wait.
- We have time.

387
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:59,826
In the following discussion...

388
00:42:39,628 --> 00:42:43,587
Go, quick. Let's move.
- What do you want here?

389
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:46,941
Shit!

390
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,941
Hands up!
- Up against the wall!

391
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,664
C'mon, Kitty!

392
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:06,783
Gudrun! Help me!

393
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,937
Stay down!

394
00:43:57,988 --> 00:44:02,982
According to reports the kidnappers
shot the doorman with tear gas

395
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:09,024
They overpowered the guards
and released Baader by force of arms.

396
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:12,104
My God, the children!

397
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:16,463
Go, children, run.

398
00:44:21,548 --> 00:44:22,901
Quickly.

399
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:29,536
<i>We say: The uniform-wearer
is a pig, not a human.</i>

400
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:34,696
<i>And so we treat it as such.
We will not negotiate with them.</i>

401
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:38,787
<i>It is wrong to talk
at all with these people.</i>

402
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:44,016
<i>And of course, they may be shot
when we consider it necessary.</i>

403
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,699
<i>The gun makes its statement.
It is possible,</i>

404
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:53,937
<i>in our actions, our enemies
may occasionally triumph.</i>

405
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:57,458
<i>But where it is important,
they will not beat us.</i>

406
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,102
<i>Our success will belong to history.</i>

407
00:45:53,388 --> 00:45:57,347
Welcome to the camp!
- The attorney looks like Fidel Castro!

408
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:01,747
Welcome, Andreas. Hi, Gudrun.
- Which way to Havana?

409
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:05,907
This is Achmed, the Commander.
This is Gudrun and Andy.

410
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:09,862
The men sleep here, the women there!
- What?

411
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:15,576
The rules of the camp.
- Shit on that. We sleep together! There!

412
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:27,977
What's Ali Baba saying?
- Forget it. Come.

413
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:33,627
It's all fine. Sleep where you like.

414
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,017
All in this house here.

415
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:55,867
Fucking shit!

416
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:59,867
This does not have
anything to do with our job!

417
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:04,425
We are urban guerrillas, understand?
We don't fight in the desert!

418
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:15,819
Tell that camel-jockey we
fight against bank guards!

419
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:21,824
French.

420
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:26,547
What are they laughing about?
- We're just admiring your trousers.

421
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:29,626
You've got them a little dirty.

422
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:47,424
I'll finish you off, you cocksucker.

423
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:50,938
Baby, leave it.
he's one of us.

424
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,586
He is not one of us.

425
00:47:54,708 --> 00:48:00,340
He's only here because he's
scared of the cops in Germany.

426
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:30,641
SICILY

427
00:48:46,028 --> 00:48:48,861
You're homesick, right?

428
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:56,660
Which means you give up.
- These people are fighting a war...

429
00:48:56,788 --> 00:49:00,747
What does our situation
in Germany have to do with it?

430
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:06,576
You can't force a revolution
there, even with a Kalashnikov.

431
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,541
Germany is just one front.

432
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:15,936
We fight with comrades everywhere
against injustice and oppression.

433
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:20,619
I thought you knew that.
- And what about your children?

434
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:25,867
You live underground.
Why bring them into it?

435
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:35,702
Sooner or later it'll come out that
I did not participate in the Baader escape.

436
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:38,786
Then I can go back legally.

437
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:42,186
I could take care of the children.

438
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:48,506
That sounds very much like betrayal.

439
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:51,103
Betrayal? Of whom?

440
00:49:57,988 --> 00:50:00,548
Look after yourself.

441
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,541
What now? Can't we have a little fun?

442
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:44,025
He won't give us any more ammunition.
- Then we go on strike.

443
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:58,742
What are they staring at?
- Probably never seen naked women before.

444
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:02,301
Hey, look who's here.

445
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:09,626
What does one do with a traitor?

446
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,028
People's court.

447
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:20,301
What?

448
00:51:21,668 --> 00:51:26,105
He asks us to get dressed.
- Why should we?

449
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:31,382
Sexual freedom and the fight
against imperialism go together.

450
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,341
He doesn't understand, Baby.

451
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:39,066
Fucking and shooting are the same!

452
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,467
Abu Hassan is commander
of the whole camp.

453
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,833
Don't worry...

454
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:34,766
...we'll bring you out.

455
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:15,147
Hands up!

456
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,461
Don't move!
Get down on the floor!

457
00:54:26,508 --> 00:54:31,582
This is a hold-up!
Get away from the window!

458
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:36,904
Get down!

459
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:43,142
In West-Berlin today, a gang robbed
three different banks in 10 minutes.

460
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:48,217
In Breitenbach Platz, three
masked men and one woman.

461
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:53,263
At 8.10 AM four men dressed in parkas...

462
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:56,426
The robbers got away with
approximately 200,000 Marks.

463
00:54:56,748 --> 00:55:00,297
It is believed that the robbers

464
00:55:00,908 --> 00:55:05,857
are militant left-wing extremists.

465
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:10,545
Detectives found a bag of
ski-masks dumped by the bandits.

466
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:15,617
They left handbills with the text
"Expropriate from enemies of the people".

467
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:27,423
217,449.50 Marks.

468
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:32,258
Not bad for 10 minutes work.
- Ulrike should write a statement.

469
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:35,221
Make clear that we only
took the money of capitalists.

470
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:40,297
That only the rich need be worried.
- Yeah, liberal wankers think that's good.

471
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:48,824
Stupid whore! Can't you
be careful? Shit-for-brains!

472
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:51,906
And so was the revolution made!

473
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:56,339
<i>Some say,
Bank robbery is not political.</i>

474
00:55:56,468 --> 00:56:01,542
<i>Revolutionaries in Latin America
call bank robbery "expropriation".</i>

475
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:04,740
Official Statement
on Bank robbery.

476
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:08,827
<i>It is politically
right to expropriate.</i>

477
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:13,141
<i>It is strategically right,
if it finances the revolution.</i>

478
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:17,307
Your children are gone.
I just heard from Sicily.

479
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:21,387
The man who took them
even knew the code word.

480
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:25,706
They're surely already
with your ex, the old fascist.

481
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:34,904
The Baader-Meinhof group will become
accepted as leaders of the revolution.

482
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:39,102
What are you doing there?
That's my car!

483
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:43,746
Yesterday five arrests were made:
Attorney Horst Mahler,

484
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:46,701
student Peggy Schönau...

485
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:51,660
In the young woman's handbag,
police found a Belgian pistol.

486
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:55,827
The charges: possession of guns,
falsification of identity papers,

487
00:56:55,948 --> 00:57:00,180
car theft, burglary,
theft and armed robbery.

488
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:05,462
In Mühlheim, Dortmund, and Konstanz,
the prisoners face similar charges.

489
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,541
Show me your identity papers.

490
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:16,504
Get back!

491
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,946
...further threats of violence...

492
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:46,899
The trial of Astrid Berger began today.

493
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:50,982
According to a study by
the Allensbacher Institute...

494
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:55,347
25% of Germans under 30
are sympathetic to the RAF.

495
00:57:55,468 --> 00:58:01,065
That's about 7 million people.

496
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:05,062
Which makes finding
them a lot more difficult.

497
00:58:05,788 --> 00:58:08,348
Lobster soup.

498
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:13,547
So we plan to
computerise identity papers.

499
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:20,947
I'll explain by
giving you an example.

500
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:27,388
Underground terrorists naturally
hide their identities from authority.

501
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,817
Without the new ID card...

502
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:33,782
no bank account.

503
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:38,027
Now they'll find it hard
to rent somewhere to live.

504
00:58:38,908 --> 00:58:42,867
Everything will require
the new cards. Gas, water, electricity.

505
00:58:43,068 --> 00:58:47,107
In Frankfurt alone, 16,000
customers usually pay bills in cash.

506
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:51,744
We will no longer accept cash.
All customers will have to use their new ID.

507
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:55,417
No ID: no health care, either.
- And then?

508
00:58:56,068 --> 00:59:00,425
Then we take it further. For example,

509
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:04,587
No ID: no driving license,
no child support payments.

510
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:10,066
If everyone has to have an ID,
the last handful who don't: suspects.

511
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:13,466
That is a mathematical certainty.

512
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:19,905
In the long term it does
nothing to smash heads.

513
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:23,458
Or, as some would prefer,
to cut heads off.

514
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:25,624
Not the police,

515
00:59:25,748 --> 00:59:30,299
but political powers
resistant to change,

516
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:33,506
allow terrorism to develop.

517
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,546
That is my opinion.

518
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:43,297
Oh, and say hello to
the minister for me.

519
00:59:50,748 --> 00:59:52,704
Shit!

520
01:00:09,028 --> 01:00:10,984
Floor it!

521
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,268
Halt!

522
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:24,057
Freeze!
Hands up! You too!

523
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:27,181
Go! Go! Petra, go!

524
01:00:28,548 --> 01:00:31,108
Drop your weapons!

525
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:56,268
Kiss my arse!

526
01:01:25,108 --> 01:01:29,659
Stop, girl! Freeze! Hands up!

527
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:59,821
Hello, Werner. You're back early.

528
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:04,101
Excuse me, this is my house.
You said one night only.

529
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:08,181
Oh, you'll have your way.
We'll be gone tomorrow.

530
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:18,698
Well, then. Tomorrow.

531
01:02:24,862 --> 01:02:28,901
...two people, a man and
a woman, ran a police roadblock...

532
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:31,582
What's wrong?

533
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:35,735
That's Petra's car.

534
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:42,056
The woman was killed
in the shootout that followed.

535
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:46,733
She opened fire when ordered
to lay down her weapon.

536
01:02:47,302 --> 01:02:48,655
Shit.

537
01:02:52,862 --> 01:02:56,821
This is war.
- Now we kill a pig.

538
01:02:57,142 --> 01:03:01,101
Cold-blooded murder.
Obviously they're shooting to kill.

539
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:06,376
They'll be hunting us all now.
- We must attack the cops directly.

540
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:11,451
Shoot down their helicopters!
Blow up their stations!

541
01:03:12,062 --> 01:03:16,658
That goes against our policy.
- I shit on the policy!

542
01:03:16,782 --> 01:03:20,741
The armed fight against Imperialists...

543
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:25,015
is against the US military presence
in Germany and in West Berlin.

544
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:30,933
We need to re-think our stategies.
- Do you think we need better plans?

545
01:03:31,062 --> 01:03:34,020
We need more safety precautions.

546
01:03:34,262 --> 01:03:39,290
Actions in cities we
don't know well are unwise.

547
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:43,893
What happened to Petra must not re-occur.
- Fuck-ups like that...

548
01:03:44,022 --> 01:03:48,493
are not caused by bad planning.
- It went wrong. It was a mistake.

549
01:03:48,622 --> 01:03:53,491
Her mistake! Not the group's.
People must follow the plans.

550
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,578
It was not the group's fault!

551
01:03:57,262 --> 01:04:02,382
The plans are all over the place.
Made up as we go along...

552
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:06,461
Nobody questions why they go wrong.
- You cunt!

553
01:04:06,582 --> 01:04:12,214
Your idea of emancipation
is the freedom to shout at men!

554
01:04:13,342 --> 01:04:16,300
Baby, you know that's nonsense.

555
01:04:28,222 --> 01:04:32,659
General Daniel Chase,
Chief-of-staff at the Pentagon, explains:

556
01:04:32,862 --> 01:04:36,218
The US Air Force
does not bomb...

557
01:04:36,462 --> 01:04:42,094
targets south of 17 degrees latitude

558
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:45,939
<i>"For the mass-murderers
of Vietnam...</i>

559
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:51,694
<i>West Germany and West Berlin
should not be safe bases.</i>

560
01:04:57,062 --> 01:05:02,011
<i>They must know that their crimes
against the Vietnamese people...</i>

561
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:05,100
<i>have created bitter enemies.</i>

562
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:09,261
<i>That there is no place in the world</i>

563

<i>"We demand an end to
the bombing of Vietnam.</i>

566

<i>We demand the withdrawal

567
01:05:39,622 --> 01:05:43,581
<i>We demand an end to the
naval blockade of North Vietnam. "</i>

568
01:05:50,942 --> 01:05:54,901
Police minister Herbert
Schoner was shot dead.

569
01:05:55,102 --> 01:06:00,051
Two shots, one in the heart.

570
01:06:01,062 --> 01:06:06,136
Also wounded was 25-year old
Manfred Fichtner from Kiel.

571
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:11,700
...in Hamburg, policeman
Heinz Eckart was shot...

<i>"We carry out attacks on

<i>Petra Schelm Brigade. "</i>

577
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:41,890
Police headquarters in
Augsburg were attacked today.

578
01:06:42,022 --> 01:06:47,050
Five policemen were injured.
An attack in Munich followed.

579
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:51,141
Experts are searching for
the remains of the explosive device.

580
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:56,450
The senior public prosecutor has
offered 10,000 Marks reward.

581
01:06:56,582 --> 01:07:00,018
The car is being examined
by Federal Police specialists.

582
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:17,891
A bomb tore apart the car of
High Court Judge Wolfgang Buddenberg,

583
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:21,060
as his wife started the engine.

584
01:07:23,462 --> 01:07:27,933
Judge Buddenberg ruled against
the Baader-Meinhof group.

585
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:32,260
His wife remains in hospital
with serious injuries...

586
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,341
but is out of intensive care.

587
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:39,500
Shit.
We need more grinders.

588
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:48,901
...there are roadblocks on all
streets near the city center.

589
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:54,176
Heavily armed police are everywhere

590
01:07:56,342 --> 01:08:00,301
Axel Springer publishing house.
- A bomb will go off in 5 minutes time.

591
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,460
Evacuate the building.
- Who are you?

592
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:07,615
Is it the nutcase again?
- Please stop calling us.

593
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:09,539
Stupid pig!

594
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:12,620
<i>We demand that Springer newspapers</i>

595
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:17,691
<i>stop publishing lies about
liberation movements of the third world,</i>

596
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:22,850
<i>particularly about the
movement to free Palestine.</i>

597
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:27,931
<i>Our actions will only cease
when our demands are met.</i>

598
01:08:32,662 --> 01:08:37,816
The Federal Government condemns these
attacks with indignation and abhorrence.

599
01:08:38,222 --> 01:08:42,977
Federal Chancellor Brandt called
the attacks "cowardly and devious".

600
01:08:43,102 --> 01:08:48,654
<i>Springer accepted the risk
that the bomb threat was genuine</i>

601
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:54,740
<i>rather than lose profits
by evacuating their workers.</i>

602
01:08:55,062 --> 01:08:58,054
<i>For capitalism,
profit is everything,</i>

603
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:01,458
<i>people, who create it, are dirt.</i>

604
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:06,531
<i>We are deeply sorry
that workers were injured...</i>

605
01:09:10,182 --> 01:09:12,332
What do you suggest?

606
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:16,535
They can see that the
government is under pressure.

607
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:19,779
We strike the water.
- Pardon?

608
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:23,861
When you strike the water,
the fish surface...

609
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:28,300
I need the entire police force,
detectives, uniformed, all of them.

610
01:09:28,422 --> 01:09:33,450
For one day, under the command of the
Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

611
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:37,541
But that would be...
That would be at least 130,000 men.

612
01:09:37,742 --> 01:09:41,701
That's right.
And all the helicopters, too.

613
01:09:41,982 --> 01:09:47,773
And to close the borders.

614
01:09:47,902 --> 01:09:52,851
We hit the entire
Federal Republic in one day.

615
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:56,941
That'll drive the fish
up and into our nets.

616
01:09:57,142 --> 01:10:02,580
Cars are being searched
all motorways and arterial roads,

617
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:07,457
causing long delays
at border crossings.

618
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:11,901
All available officials
in West Germany are taking part.

619
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:18,059
By noon today, police
in Hamberg checked 15,000 cars.

620
01:10:18,182 --> 01:10:22,141
It's a police state,
just like you said.

621
01:10:22,342 --> 01:10:25,379
The public supports these measures.

622
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:29,461
It's not looking
good for the Revolution.

623
01:10:29,622 --> 01:10:34,616
Shut up! Urban guerrillas operate
in the rift between the state and the people!

624
01:10:37,062 --> 01:10:42,375
Checkpoints have been set up at all
public buildings, airports, and sporting events.

625
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:47,821
Vehicles were searched. Photographs of
possible RAF members were distributed.

626
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:52,697
As Mao Tse-tung once said...
you've heard it before...

627
01:10:52,822 --> 01:10:56,781
but I'll remind you today. He said:

628
01:10:57,342 --> 01:11:00,300
"When the enemy slanders us,

629
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:03,539
that is good.
Because it proves,

630
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:09,214
that there is a clear
line between them and us.

631
01:11:09,342 --> 01:11:14,700
When the enemy paints
us in the blackest colors,

632
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:18,019
that's better.
Because it shows,

633
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:22,101
that there is not only a clear
distinction between them and us,

634
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:27,297
but also that we have achieved
a great deal in our work. "

635
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:06,781
The container.
It's been moved.

636
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:17,335
That's not my powder.

637
01:12:29,022 --> 01:12:31,855
Don't move! Police!

638
01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:39,980
Freeze! Drop the gun!

639
01:12:50,902 --> 01:12:53,860
Halt! Police!
Drop the gun!

640
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,575
Shit!

641
01:13:34,822 --> 01:13:38,895
Throw your weapons
into the yard and come out!

642
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:44,374
The longer you wait,
the stronger our forces.

643
01:13:44,902 --> 01:13:48,611
We have you surrounded.
There is no chance of escape.

644
01:13:48,742 --> 01:13:52,701
Come out or we'll storm
the building. Why are you waiting?

645
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:02,376
I repeat:
Come out now.

646
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:06,501
You have no chance,
this is not a game.

647
01:14:20,182 --> 01:14:24,141
Do you want to get out of this alive?

648
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:29,735
There is no chance of escape.

649
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:34,454
Your only chance is to surrender now.

650
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:43,491
If you come out with hands up,
nothing will happen to you.

651
01:14:45,702 --> 01:14:50,901
We can wait all day.
We are in control here.

652
01:14:51,022 --> 01:14:54,571
We control the entire area.
There is no way out.

653
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:10,941
Police searching for the Baader-Meinhof group

654
01:15:11,062 --> 01:15:15,135
in Frankfurt this morning
achieved a major success

655
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:20,894
Beside Baader, Holger Meins was arrested,
which greatly weakens the leadership of the group.

656
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:29,375
Shit.

657
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:45,180
There, great Terrorist.
Shoot your way out.

658
01:15:56,982 --> 01:16:00,657
That's for Norbert.
- And that's for Heinz.

659
01:16:42,262 --> 01:16:47,416
Can I try it on?
- Changing room over there.

660
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,499
This way. That's the jacket.

661
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:26,786
No! No!

662
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:43,901
No! Help!

663
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,859
No! Fucking cops!

664
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:52,935
Let go! No!

665
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:09,386
Is that you?

666
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:13,299
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?

667
01:19:33,306 --> 01:19:35,376
Silence.

668
01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:57,339
I'm over here!
I'm over here!

669
01:20:05,946 --> 01:20:07,823
Here!

670
01:20:08,106 --> 01:20:10,336
I'm over here!

671
01:20:10,466 --> 01:20:12,024
Here!

672
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:27,660
The Minister of the Interior
congratulates you on your great successes.

673
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:31,745
The Minister of the Interior
says the RAF is finished.

674
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:49,585
I now declare the 1972 Olympic Games open.

675
01:20:55,746 --> 01:20:57,498
World record!

676
01:20:57,626 --> 01:21:02,575
...in disguise, into the
the Israeli teams's lodgings.

677
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:07,575
...Israeli Coach Moshe Weinberg
was killed with two shots to the head...

678
01:21:07,706 --> 01:21:13,622
The Black September group is
demanding the release of over 230 prisoners

679
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:21,696
...in exchange for the release of the hostages.

680
01:21:21,906 --> 01:21:26,934
If the prisoners are not released
the hostages will be killed...

681
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:32,186
Our worst fears have
become bitter reality.

682
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:40,265
With the terrible events of the past week...

683
01:21:40,466 --> 01:21:44,505
at The Munich Olympics,
all of our hopes for peace...

684
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:48,585
have come crashing down.

685
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:53,814
We cannot remove all the hatred
and violence from this world

686
01:21:53,946 --> 01:21:59,498
We must be prepared to fight
the forces of evil.

687
01:22:01,946 --> 01:22:03,857
Gentlemen,

688
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:07,945
our duty is to fight terrorism.

689
01:22:08,146 --> 01:22:12,105
And, if possible, to end it.
Tell me your ideas.

690
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:16,458
We need a special force,
to shut down these lunatics.

691
01:22:16,586 --> 01:22:21,614
Strong words don't
work against terrorists.

692
01:22:21,746 --> 01:22:24,704
A special-purpose force
is absolutley crucial.

693
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:29,934
But those measures alone
will not solve the problem.

694
01:22:30,066 --> 01:22:33,024
The roots lie deeper.
- Namely?

695
01:22:33,266 --> 01:22:37,305
The Israeli occupation of Palestine.
Nobody pays attention to that.

696
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:41,544
So the terrorists try to
force the world to pay attention.

697
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:46,694
So you approve of their aims?
- Nadler, don't talk rubbish.

698
01:22:46,826 --> 01:22:50,660
I never said that.
However,

699
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:55,617
one must understand their motives.

700
01:22:55,826 --> 01:22:59,785
So, you allow these
murderers a special status?

701
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:04,465
No! But we can't
fight such forces rigidly.

702
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:07,703
And our ignorance promotes terrorism!

703
01:23:07,826 --> 01:23:10,863
It's true,
but the question is...

704
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:15,264
whether terrorism
is the new form of war.

705
01:23:15,386 --> 01:23:19,937
Whether it replaces conventional war,
which does not take place any more.

706
01:23:20,306 --> 01:23:24,265
I don't follow you.
What about the victims?

707
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:28,539
Or their loved ones?
- I understand your anger.

708
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:32,625
But our duty is to fight terrorism.

709
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:37,820
And to do that we must understand
the problems of the third world.

710
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:42,895
The Middle East conflict, the Vietnam war.
Understand these problems objectively!

711
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:57,615
<i>It feels like an explosion in the head.</i>

712
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:00,659
<i>Like the cell is full of pressure.</i>

713
01:24:00,826 --> 01:24:05,502
<i>The one feeling
I can't supress. Rage.</i>

714
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:11,258
<i>The is no release from the pressure.
That's the worst thing about isolation.</i>

715
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:16,345
<i>The clear knowledge that one
does not have a chance of survival.</i>

716
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:28,375
Today we begin a hunger strike.

717
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:32,055
We demand change to
one of the prison conditions:

718
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:37,540
Equal conditions for political
prisoners to all other prisoners.

719
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:42,345
A hunger strike is our only way...

720
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:46,380
to resist in solitary confinement.

721
01:24:49,586 --> 01:24:52,544
<i>The hunger strike is to show</i>

722
01:24:52,746 --> 01:24:57,297
<i>that we will not compromise.</i>

723
01:24:57,906 --> 01:25:02,900
<i>We expect explosions
in the prison system.</i>

724
01:25:05,106 --> 01:25:09,065
<i>The goals must be
set out so that each Rocker,</i>

725
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:13,225
<i>so everyone, does not
lose their sense of purpose.</i>

726
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:16,895
<i>That is, so that
they do not break us.</i>

727
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:23,306
<i>We can say: Each 3rd week,
or each 2nd or 4th week, whatever...</i>

728
01:25:24,026 --> 01:25:26,859
<i>one of us will die.</i>

729
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:29,905
<i>And so on, until the isolation,</i>

730
01:25:30,026 --> 01:25:33,860
<i>until the torture for all is waived.</i>

731
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:40,545
<i>But the hunger strike will only work
if we all stick to it together</i>

732
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:45,615
<i>Until our demands are met.
Even if some of us die.</i>

733
01:25:56,226 --> 01:26:01,175
Counsellor, just a few minutes.
The prisoner is very much weakened.

734
01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:11,224
Gudrun wrote to me.

735
01:26:17,746 --> 01:26:22,866
This is our goal. You decide it,
when you die. Freedom or death.

736
01:26:23,826 --> 01:26:28,138
Just in case,
if I pass from this life,

737
01:26:29,866 --> 01:26:32,426
It's murder.

738
01:26:34,226 --> 01:26:39,175
If the pigs keep this up, it's murder.
Do not believe the lies of murderers.

739
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,746
Get me a cigarette.

740
01:27:00,986 --> 01:27:04,945
<i>I don't know what will
happen, I should die.</i>

741
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:08,539
<i>If I'm killed.</i>

742
01:27:09,946 --> 01:27:12,506
<i>What next?</i>

743
01:27:17,706 --> 01:27:19,458
<i>That's it.</i>

744
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:24,024
<i>Which side is right?</i>

745
01:27:26,586 --> 01:27:29,419
<i>It's not so clear.</i>

746
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:35,820
<i>The final battle to free
mankind from the pigs.</i>

747
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:40,939
<i>The revolutionary struggle.</i>

748
01:27:43,146 --> 01:27:47,537
<i>With love for life
and with contempt for death.</i>

749
01:27:50,106 --> 01:27:53,462
<i>I serve the people.</i>

750
01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:04,024
Get the prison doctor here, now.
- But it's the weekend.

751
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:08,105
Then get his assistant.
- We don't have one.

752
01:28:08,306 --> 01:28:12,345
Then call in an outside doctor.
- We're not authorized.

753
01:28:12,466 --> 01:28:17,017
He's dying in there!
Get a doctor! Now!

754
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:21,024
Unfortunately, we can't do a thing.

755
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:03,340
One day after the death of Holger Meins,

756
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:08,694
of the Baader-Meinhof Group,
who died while on hunger strike,

757
01:29:08,826 --> 01:29:13,900
Berlin Chief Justice Drenkmann
was shot dead in his home.

758
01:29:14,026 --> 01:29:18,975
<i>We do not shed tears for Drenkmann.
We are pleased by his execution.</i>

759
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:24,214
...attacks on judges and lawyers
who prosecuted the Anarchists.

760
01:29:24,346 --> 01:29:29,340
Lawyers for Holger Meins today
launched a wrongful death action...

761
01:29:29,466 --> 01:29:33,937
<i>It was necessary, because
each judge and cop must know...</i>

762
01:29:34,066 --> 01:29:38,457
<i>that they will be held
responsible for their deeds.</i>

763
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,784
That's Rudi Dutschke.

764
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:16,979
Holger, the fight goes on.

765
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:48,814
The trial of Baader and the others
begins in 4 weeks, here in Stammheim.

766
01:30:55,626 --> 01:30:59,665
The pictures are of the
security wing on the 7th floor.

767
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:04,860
The prisoners will be kept here.
- Men and women together?

768
01:31:04,986 --> 01:31:08,945
Indeed, they demanded it.
- Outrageous.

769
01:31:09,186 --> 01:31:13,543
So they will cooperate during the trial.
- We provide a terror center!

770
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:18,694
It's important that
the trial goes smoothly.

771
01:31:18,826 --> 01:31:22,944
We of the Federal Police can
monitor the group's communications.

772
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:26,024
And we most certainly will.

773
01:31:30,506 --> 01:31:32,542
Go! Go!

774
01:31:33,066 --> 01:31:35,899
Everyone out! Go!

775
01:32:36,186 --> 01:32:41,419
The German Embassy in Stockholm
was occupied by terrorists today

776
01:32:41,626 --> 01:32:44,584
They threaten to kill hostages
unless their demands are met.

777
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:48,819
The terrorists have released
a statement to the German government.

778
01:32:48,946 --> 01:32:53,974
Eye-witnesses reported shots.
The police closed off the area.

779
01:32:54,106 --> 01:32:57,064
About 100 People reportedly
remain in the embassy.

780
01:32:57,266 --> 01:33:01,305
Emergency units are treating
those who escaped the building

781
01:33:01,426 --> 01:33:06,454
A caller claiming to be a member
of the RAF demanded the release...

782
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:11,057
Authorities believe the attack
is a last desperate attempt...

783
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:15,577
to demand the release of RAF prisoners
in Stammheim before the trial begins.

784
01:33:15,706 --> 01:33:20,143
No fire in the cell!
- Kiss my arse. We're leaving.

785
01:33:20,306 --> 01:33:23,343
...will shoot one hostage every hour.

786
01:33:23,466 --> 01:33:28,017
Storm the building and
we blow up it. We leave only...

787
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,318
if our demands are fulfilled.

788
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:37,499
Withdraw or they blow it up!

789
01:33:41,146 --> 01:33:46,618
They refuse to withdraw.
- Then we prove we're serious. Translate.

790
01:33:47,226 --> 01:33:51,185
I am von Mirbach, Military Attaché.
They will shoot me...

791
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:56,820
if you do not withdraw.
- Leave! Leave now!

792
01:34:05,226 --> 01:34:09,344
The first explosion
occurred shortly before midnight.

793
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:15,382
In minutes the whole building was
in flames, while the terrorists dug in.

794
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:18,738
The explosions
followed each other closely...

795
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:22,825
as police stormed the burning building.

796
01:34:24,106 --> 01:34:28,975
The hostage drama, which ended
last night in explosions and gunfire,

797
01:34:29,106 --> 01:34:34,180
has claimed at least three lives,
two of them embassy staff.

798
01:34:34,306 --> 01:34:39,334
Among them was Heinz Hillegaart,
chief of the catering department.

799
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:42,503
It is still unclear whether he was shot,
like Military Attache von Mirbach,

800
01:34:42,626 --> 01:34:47,575
or whether he died in the explosions.
The 3rd death was one of the terrorists.

801
01:34:47,706 --> 01:34:52,734
Five terrorists were arrested:
Siegfried Hausner, Bernhard Rössner,

802
01:34:52,866 --> 01:34:56,700
Karl-Heinz Dellwo, Lutz Taufner
and Hanna Krabbe.

803
01:34:56,946 --> 01:35:00,905
What a shitty action.

804
01:35:04,226 --> 01:35:06,899
Shitty action!

805
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:12,260
The Swedish government delivered
the captured terrorists to Germany.

806
01:35:12,386 --> 01:35:17,540
Today the severely wounded
Siegfried Hausner was flown to Stammheim.

807
01:35:19,266 --> 01:35:23,225
I'll hold you responsible!
If the prisoner dies,

808
01:35:23,466 --> 01:35:27,459
he'll be, after Holger Meins,
the second to die in our custody.

809
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:32,706
With such incompetence we'll
give the RAF another martyr!

810
01:35:33,346 --> 01:35:37,544
This is a prison. We're not
equipped for severely wounded people!

811
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:41,944
We must keep him here. Orders.
- That's completely insane.

812
01:35:42,066 --> 01:35:46,503
The two public defenders
are sufficient for Mr Baader.

813
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:49,703
If he doesn't want them, too bad.

814
01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:53,819
They do not defend me.
They never even spoke with me!

815
01:35:53,946 --> 01:35:59,020
Incidently, someone has written
"head off" beside my microphone.

816
01:35:59,146 --> 01:36:03,697
Beside my microphone it says "head off"!
What do you think it means?

817
01:36:03,826 --> 01:36:06,784
I don't know what it means.

818
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:12,735
I am unable to take part in this trial.

819
01:36:13,346 --> 01:36:18,374
I am not nearly able,
in this place, at this time,

820
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,294
I cannot say what...
I mean... I can't tell...

821
01:36:22,426 --> 01:36:28,342
I request an examination for us,
by an independent physician.

822
01:36:28,626 --> 01:36:29,979
Rejected.

823
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:35,214
They say we're not isolated,
because we have slightly larger cells.

824
01:36:35,346 --> 01:36:40,420
I say: We were,
up till a short time ago,

825
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:44,459
completely isolated for the last 3 years!

826
01:36:44,586 --> 01:36:49,137
Our only human contact was
through a tiny slot in the cell door.

827
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:54,585
Someone stood behind the door and wrote.
- I rule you out of order!

828
01:37:01,906 --> 01:37:06,457
Why do you change my notes
suddenly, without explanation?

829
01:37:06,626 --> 01:37:11,780
Because that things
you write have no power.

830
01:37:13,146 --> 01:37:16,104
There's no need to do that.

831
01:37:19,106 --> 01:37:23,657
You jump on my errors
and go on and on about it.

832
01:37:24,546 --> 01:37:29,700
I could write a book on
your foolishness. Guard!

833
01:37:30,106 --> 01:37:33,940
Your tired act,
I'm sick of it.

834
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:38,822
I've had my fill of this.
You're driving me crazy!

835
01:37:44,146 --> 01:37:47,104
Really, I don't get it.

836
01:37:47,346 --> 01:37:50,304
What's their problem, the bitches?

837
01:37:50,466 --> 01:37:54,744
It's the last straw that
they allowed Hausner to die.

838
01:37:54,866 --> 01:37:58,825
They're not fooling anyone.
- You're a bullshit revolutionary!

839
01:37:59,466 --> 01:38:02,299
We have to get out of here.

840
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:06,545
It's not easy to recruit
new troops after Stockholm.

841
01:38:06,946 --> 01:38:12,623
You argue with your emotion,
you shitty egoist! You have no clue!

842
01:38:12,906 --> 01:38:15,739
Not a clue! Piss off!

843
01:38:17,946 --> 01:38:20,779
Piss off, arsehole!

844
01:38:21,346 --> 01:38:24,179
Get us out of here, you sow!

845
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:27,186
Get us out of here!

846
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:30,586
Sow! Arsehole!

847
01:38:30,786 --> 01:38:33,300
Get us out of here, you sow!

848
01:38:51,786 --> 01:38:56,177
Mrs Meinhof, you are obliged to remain.
The accusations against you stand.

849
01:38:56,306 --> 01:39:00,140
You can't force me, arsehole.

850
01:39:01,546 --> 01:39:06,415
I decide that, "arsehole" or not.

851
01:39:06,546 --> 01:39:09,936
It's about time you admitted it.

852
01:39:10,066 --> 01:39:13,138
The accused is today excluded,

853
01:39:13,266 --> 01:39:16,622
Because she called
the chairman an "arsehole".

854
01:39:16,786 --> 01:39:21,302
Then you also exclude me.
- That's not for you to decide!

855
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:26,500
Does it come to physical force?
- Sit! Sit down in your place.

856
01:39:26,626 --> 01:39:31,654
Go on with your ridiculous procedure.
I'll disturb it so long as I'm here.

857
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:34,744
Do we really need to hear it?

858
01:39:34,946 --> 01:39:39,940
I'll say it too:
You're a fascist arsehole!

859
01:39:41,746 --> 01:39:46,774
We can't defend ourselves
so we refuse to participate.

860
01:39:46,906 --> 01:39:48,783
Old sow.

861
01:39:50,346 --> 01:39:53,975
You... you are deranged!

862
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:58,865
Did I hear you
call me an "old sow"?

863
01:39:59,186 --> 01:40:03,020
Did I hear that right,
or am I mistaken?

864
01:40:03,506 --> 01:40:07,465
I want it to be carefully noted!
And you, Mr Baader,

865
01:40:08,626 --> 01:40:12,585
You called me a
"fascist arsehole".

866
01:40:12,866 --> 01:40:14,822
Filthy rat.

867
01:40:16,986 --> 01:40:19,944
The defendants are excused.

868
01:40:20,226 --> 01:40:23,775
This court
adjourns for consulation.

869
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:44,698
<i>Ulrike, how is she? Very dark.
A Vampire, trembling with bloodlust.</i>

870
01:40:44,946 --> 01:40:48,905
<i>Ulrike tries to laugh,
it doesn't work.</i>

871
01:40:49,226 --> 01:40:54,175
<i>Necrophile. Hysteric.
Really absolutely ugly me.</i>

872
01:41:25,866 --> 01:41:29,825
<i>Although I still say
my reason hasn't left me.</i>

873
01:41:30,026 --> 01:41:32,586
<i>It's separate from me.</i>

874
01:41:57,306 --> 01:41:59,866
This is shit.

875
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:12,582
She gives me false information.
Gudrun transcribes it wrong.

876
01:42:13,706 --> 01:42:18,382
Why do you do that?
Is it because you want to torment me?

877
01:42:18,586 --> 01:42:22,420
I return the agony.
An eye for an eye.

878
01:42:24,426 --> 01:42:28,385
I don't look at it.
I can't bear it.

879
01:42:28,626 --> 01:42:32,585
I am not a witch,
but I am sometimes brutal.

880
01:42:32,786 --> 01:42:36,825
Don't pretend.
You hate us. It's obvious.

881
01:42:36,946 --> 01:42:41,861
So stop eating, until you're
better, or go to the Devil.

882
01:42:41,986 --> 01:42:46,537
How are we to attain our goals,
if we blow workers up?

883
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:51,182
Show the reports you wrote on us.
- I know, Springer was an error.

884
01:42:51,306 --> 01:42:56,460
That went against our aims.
- We've discussed this a thousand times.

885
01:42:57,146 --> 01:43:02,095
We've been through this! Many times!
- The action was counter revolutionary!

886
01:43:02,306 --> 01:43:06,140
Real revolutionaries would
have shot you for that!

887
01:43:32,746 --> 01:43:36,705
The question is:
How can an isolated prisoner...

888
01:43:37,986 --> 01:43:43,902
make the authorities recognise
that his behavior has changed? How?

889
01:43:45,106 --> 01:43:50,863
In isolation, the prisoner can't
show that his behaviour has changed.

890
01:43:51,026 --> 01:43:54,985
There's only one possibility.
And that is betrayal.

891
01:43:55,626 --> 01:43:59,858
The prisoner in isolation
has no other chance.

892
01:43:59,986 --> 01:44:03,945
So there are two possibilities.

893
01:44:04,186 --> 01:44:08,657
I will speak now!
A prisoner can be silent,

894
01:44:08,786 --> 01:44:12,904
and die,
or a prisoner can talk.

895
01:44:13,026 --> 01:44:17,975
That is confession and betrayal.
And based on this fact,

896
01:44:18,106 --> 01:44:23,021
the Federal High Court resolution
makes a clear and definite statement.

897
01:44:23,146 --> 01:44:27,537
That is torture.
Designed to force confessions.

898
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:32,342
To confuse, demoralise, and punish.

899
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:35,424
You're the knife in the back of the RAF.

900
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:39,459
Because you never learn.

901
01:44:58,866 --> 01:45:04,020
<i>It is mysterious,
if I say I can't bear it?</i>

902
01:45:05,146 --> 01:45:10,095
<i>I don't bear it any more.
That is what I can't bear.</i>

903
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:30,214
We are responsible for the
attacks on CIA headquarters...

904
01:45:30,346 --> 01:45:35,978
on the 5th US Corps in Frankfurt
and on US headquarters in Heidelberg.

905
01:45:36,106 --> 01:45:40,543
We are also
responsible for the bombing

906
01:45:40,746 --> 01:45:46,457
of the Springer building.
Beyond that, we have no knowledge.

907
01:45:46,946 --> 01:45:53,545
We had no part in the planning
or the execution of any other actions.

908
01:46:18,346 --> 01:46:22,305
The Anarchist Ulrike
Meinhof took her own life.

909
01:46:22,506 --> 01:46:27,136
She was found dead this morning
in her cell in Stuttgart-Stammheim.

910
01:46:27,266 --> 01:46:30,099
Ulrike Meinhof, that was murder!

911
01:46:30,586 --> 01:46:36,343
The 41-year-old hung herself with
a towel tied to the window bars.

912
01:46:36,546 --> 01:46:40,619
There will be an autopsy later today.

913
01:46:40,746 --> 01:46:45,820
The 109th day of the hearing in Stammheim
was unusually crowded this morning.

914
01:46:45,946 --> 01:46:51,066
The court-appointed defense
counsels made a request...

915
01:46:51,186 --> 01:46:55,020
to adjourn the trial for 10 days.

916
01:46:55,346 --> 01:47:01,023
To investigate whether Ulrike
Meinhof really committed suicide.

917
01:47:01,146 --> 01:47:04,104
We believe Ulrike was executed.

918
01:47:04,266 --> 01:47:09,260
We don't know how, but we know who.
Chief Federal Prosecutor Buback said:

919
01:47:09,386 --> 01:47:13,538
"The State protects those
who support the State.

920
01:47:13,666 --> 01:47:18,694
Herold and I always find a way. "
- These defamatory remarks...

921
01:47:18,826 --> 01:47:24,139
It was a coldly conceived execution!
Like Holger Meins and Siegfried Hausner!

922
01:47:24,266 --> 01:47:27,224
The execution of Ulrike now!

923
01:47:28,186 --> 01:47:31,019
Fascist! Murderer!
- Silence!

924
01:47:31,346 --> 01:47:37,182
Under your jurisdiction as judges
two prisoners out of five were killed!

925
01:47:48,586 --> 01:47:53,660
Why were Schubert, Möller
and Mohnhaupt brought to Stammheim?

926
01:47:53,786 --> 01:47:58,541
The public prosecutor's office gave in
to the pressure of public opinion.

927
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:03,694
I allowed it, in order
to prevent further suicides.

928
01:48:03,826 --> 01:48:05,737
Baader und Ensslin...

929
01:48:05,866 --> 01:48:10,815
RAF prisoners were allowed
to transfer to Stammheim.

930
01:48:13,026 --> 01:48:16,985
Time's up! Return to your cells!
- Stop eating.

931
01:48:19,386 --> 01:48:24,540
Mohnhaupt will be free in 7 Months.
Those jerks guaranteed it.

932
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:29,786
Baader and Ensslin
probably insisted on it.

933
01:49:11,506 --> 01:49:14,339
Lovely to see you.

934
01:49:15,546 --> 01:49:18,106
Are you Charlie?

935
01:49:21,146 --> 01:49:23,979
I want to talk with him alone.

936
01:49:25,586 --> 01:49:29,545
Andreas and Gudrun trust you.
- How are they?

937
01:49:29,866 --> 01:49:33,905
They're shitty! We must
get them out of there, soon.

938
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:37,063
Before they end up
like Ulrike und Holger.

939
01:49:37,186 --> 01:49:42,214
A few think we should hijack
a 747 and circle it over Bonn.

940
01:49:42,346 --> 01:49:46,817
With an ultimatum to exchange
our people in 6 to 8 hours.

941
01:49:46,946 --> 01:49:51,019
Then let it fall.
In the middle of Bonn.

942
01:49:51,146 --> 01:49:55,583
We heard of that plan. No.
No actions against the people.

943
01:49:55,706 --> 01:50:00,780
We stick with the kidnappings.
How far advanced are you?

944
01:50:00,906 --> 01:50:04,455
Ready to go.
Here, before I forget it...

945
01:50:06,586 --> 01:50:09,419
I brought this for you.

946
01:50:11,386 --> 01:50:14,742
Nearly 5 years prison...
- It's a long time.

947
01:50:16,786 --> 01:50:19,744
That's how long since I fucked a guy.

948
01:50:41,506 --> 01:50:47,138
They need weapons.
If another escape attempt fails...

949
01:50:48,186 --> 01:50:52,145
They want to be able to make a choice.

950
01:50:55,706 --> 01:51:00,143
You must not mention it
to the others. No matter what happens.

951
01:51:02,346 --> 01:51:05,304
Very pretty, the medal.
- Very much.

952
01:51:05,586 --> 01:51:07,656
Congrats!

953
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:10,744
You work on your honour day?

954
01:51:10,986 --> 01:51:15,537
Gottfried Hagemann. You remember,
the lawyer. With his arrest...

955
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:21,582
We found coded
operational plans on him.

956
01:51:24,306 --> 01:51:26,866
Big arsehole.

957
01:51:28,346 --> 01:51:33,818
HM Auschecken. Margarine.
What is your conclusion?

958
01:51:34,346 --> 01:51:39,295
Siegfried, we're expecting an
act of revenge against you.

959
01:51:43,866 --> 01:51:50,658
<i>On 7.4.77 the Kommando Ulrike Meinhof
executed Chief Federal Prosecutor Buback.</i>

960
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:59,024
<i>Siegfried Buback was directly
responsible for the murder of Holger Meins,</i>

961
01:51:59,146 --> 01:52:01,501
<i>Siegfried Hausner, and Ulrike Meinhof.</i>

962
01:52:01,626 --> 01:52:06,575
<i>As Chief Federal Prosecutor,
he ordered their murders.</i>

963
01:52:22,026 --> 01:52:25,143
<i>Under Bubacks regime,
Holger on 9.11.74.</i>

964
01:52:25,266 --> 01:52:28,815
<i>was murdered by starvation.</i>

965
01:52:29,026 --> 01:52:32,063
<i>Under Bubacks regime,
Ulrike on 9.5.76.</i>

966
01:52:32,186 --> 01:52:35,735
<i>was illegally executed,</i>

967
01:52:36,186 --> 01:52:39,223
<i>in a faked suicide by hanging.</i>

968
01:52:39,346 --> 01:52:43,385
<i>Under our laws, for which
Ulrike fought, justice was done.</i>

969
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:48,500
<i>We will not allow our
comrades to be murdered,</i>

970
01:52:48,626 --> 01:52:53,654
<i>We will show the authorities that
when prisoners continue to fight,</i>

971
01:52:53,786 --> 01:52:59,702
<i>killing them will not solve the
problem. Kommando Ulrike Meinhof.</i>

972
01:53:05,666 --> 01:53:09,500
We could not protect him.
- I ask myself:

973
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:15,782
Why do new terror units always
develop? What motivates them?

974
01:53:18,586 --> 01:53:20,542
A myth.

975
01:53:56,906 --> 01:54:00,103
Come on in,
Mr Ponto is expecting you.

976
01:54:00,226 --> 01:54:01,579
Thanks.

977
01:54:07,026 --> 01:54:11,895
You brought a whole committee.
- I wanted to show them your place.

978
01:54:12,026 --> 01:54:14,984
My friends. Klara.
- Good day.

979
01:54:15,106 --> 01:54:18,064
Gerd.
- Herr Ponto, shall I stay?

980
01:54:18,506 --> 01:54:21,543
No, you may go.
Come outside.

981
01:54:26,986 --> 01:54:32,219
What a lovely surprise.
I'll be with you in a moment.

982
01:54:32,986 --> 01:54:36,820
I'll put those in a vase. Sit down.

983
01:54:37,586 --> 01:54:38,939
Klara.

984
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:57,545
Go to the exit. Come along.
- Are you mad?

985
01:54:57,786 --> 01:55:01,745
You are a prisoner of the RAF.
- Are you mad?

986
01:55:20,146 --> 01:55:22,102
Go, get out!

987
01:55:24,426 --> 01:55:28,977
I didn't want that!
How do I explain to my parents?

988
01:55:29,586 --> 01:55:34,262
We agreed, no guns! And only a tap
on the head, if he resists.

989
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:38,777
We wanted to kidnap him!
- Why are you here?

990
01:55:38,906 --> 01:55:44,264
To play the female Robin Hood
without getting your hands dirty?

991
01:55:44,386 --> 01:55:49,335
You crybaby! You sign the claim
of responsibility. - No! Never!

992
01:56:00,226 --> 01:56:05,220
<i>On the execution of Ponto, we say:</i>

993
01:56:05,346 --> 01:56:10,466
<i>It is a clear warning to those types.</i>

994
01:56:10,586 --> 01:56:14,625
<i>If you wage war on the people,
then war will be waged on you.</i>

995
01:56:15,466 --> 01:56:19,015
<i>Susanne Albrecht,
soldier of the RAF.</i>

996
01:56:29,226 --> 01:56:32,059
The door stays open!

997
01:56:32,426 --> 01:56:38,058
We do not accept locked doors!
Hey! No locked doors!

998
01:56:42,186 --> 01:56:46,020
Now you'll have the war you wanted!

999
01:56:49,466 --> 01:56:52,663
You pigs! You filthy pigs!

1000
01:56:53,986 --> 01:56:57,820
Let me go. Idiot.
Fucking shitty cops!

1001
01:56:59,626 --> 01:57:02,584
You wanker! Fucking leave her alone!

1002
01:57:03,786 --> 01:57:06,619
You sow! Let go!

1003
01:57:15,866 --> 01:57:19,700
How much longer?
- Soon. Nearly done.

1004
01:57:21,466 --> 01:57:24,299
229, 12th line, 4th word.

1005
01:57:24,666 --> 01:57:26,941
9, 10, 11, 12... 3,4.

1006
01:57:30,466 --> 01:57:31,785
Finished.

1007
01:57:33,426 --> 01:57:37,385
<i>We forestalled our
planned liquidation.</i>

1008
01:57:37,586 --> 01:57:41,261
<i>We retain our identity.</i>

1009
01:57:41,386 --> 01:57:45,857
"We know there is a
concrete plan to kill us.

1010
01:57:45,986 --> 01:57:50,184
Surrender is impossible.
You must hurry.

1011
01:57:51,706 --> 01:57:54,664
We do not need to say more. "

1012
01:57:56,266 --> 01:58:01,215
That is clear. If we do nothing,
they've given us straight facts.

1013
01:58:01,986 --> 01:58:06,980
What "straight facts"?
- It's very clear, OK?

1014
01:58:07,106 --> 01:58:10,940
If we don't get them out
immediately, they're dead.

1015
01:58:13,266 --> 01:58:17,225
Now what?
- Schleyer goes on vacation tomorrow.

1016
01:58:17,986 --> 01:58:21,535
For how long?
- Several weeks.

1017
01:58:22,066 --> 01:58:26,025
Then let's do it
tomorrow. Why not?

1018
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:30,225
We'll have to do it the hard way.
- What's that mean? Hard?

1019
01:58:31,306 --> 01:58:36,175
It means we shoot the escorts,
all of them, to get to Schleyer.

1020
01:58:36,306 --> 01:58:41,938
The SEK are armed and trained.
It'll be a combat situation.

1021
01:58:42,266 --> 01:58:46,225
The driver isn't SEK, though.
- You miserable wanker!

1022
01:58:46,386 --> 01:58:50,345
The prisoners will be murdered!
- Stop it!

1023
01:58:51,866 --> 01:58:55,825
Let's get our plan in order.
- I can't do this.

1024
01:58:58,026 --> 01:59:01,985
I can't be a part of this.
- OK. Then you better leave now.

1025
01:59:02,706 --> 01:59:07,860
We need to discuss plans.
They don't concern you any more.

1026
01:59:17,506 --> 01:59:21,465
Brigitte, you can't do this.
If you're captured again...

1027
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:25,705
I am in charge here.
We'll discuss that later.

1028
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:30,980
Now let's find out who's
willing to do it the hard way.

1029
01:59:35,146 --> 01:59:37,102
What about you?

1030
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:49,624
It's safe to assume...

1031
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:55,503
that Schleyer is being held
within 20 km of the scene.

1032
02:00:55,786 --> 02:00:59,620
Less than two hours ago it happened.

1033
02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:04,459
Five weeks after the
murder of the banker Ponto...

1034
02:01:04,586 --> 02:01:09,580
an assassination attempt
on Hanns Martin Schleyer.

1035
02:01:09,706 --> 02:01:13,665
Four police officers from
the escort were killed.

1036
02:01:13,866 --> 02:01:17,700
The search for
the attackers continues.

1037
02:01:18,026 --> 02:01:22,463
Schleyer is not among
the dead. It is obvious...

1038
02:01:23,106 --> 02:01:28,464
that the terrorists
have kidnapped him.

1039
02:01:28,786 --> 02:01:32,335
The manhunt goes on.

1040
02:01:32,586 --> 02:01:37,614
All the official parties
condemned the attack on Schleyer.

1041
02:01:38,786 --> 02:01:42,984
Now you have a problem.
Now you have a big problem!

1042
02:02:27,466 --> 02:02:31,300
Their reign of terror has not yet ended.

1043
02:02:31,626 --> 02:02:36,859
And they are feeling triumphant now.

1044
02:02:36,986 --> 02:02:39,944
But they must make no mistake.

1045
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:44,623
...the Siegfried Hausner Kommando...

1046
02:02:44,826 --> 02:02:49,900
has taken the president of the employers
association, Hanns Martin Schleyer, prisoner.

1047
02:02:50,026 --> 02:02:53,018
The will of the German people is not broken.

1048
02:03:01,019 --> 02:03:03,019
They're sealing us in!
- They're doing what?

1049
02:05:27,588 --> 02:05:32,135
A Lufthansa airliner has been hijacked.

1050
02:05:32,457 --> 02:05:35,584
The aircraft was en route from Majorca
to Frankfurt, but was diverted to Rome.

1051
02:05:35,704 --> 02:05:40,519
86 passengers, mostly
Germans, are on board.

1052
02:05:42,976 --> 02:05:45,369
...footage of kidnapped
businessman Hanns Schleyer...

1053
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:47,762
reading a statement from his captors...

1054
02:05:52,541 --> 02:05:55,667
You can see my current circumstances.

1055
02:05:56,217 --> 02:06:01,108
The government in Bonn
must make a decision.

1056
02:06:01,533 --> 02:06:06,181
The actions of the German goverment
prove that they are the terrorists.

1057
02:06:07,363 --> 02:06:11,770
The state, which claims to promote freedom...

1058
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:17,383
...uses the methods of totaliarianism...

1059
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:21,783
in the name of fighting terrorism.

1060
02:06:21,903 --> 02:06:26,020
I Have, so far, been
treated well by my captors...

1061
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:37,423
Pressure on the
government is growing...

1062
02:06:38,018 --> 02:06:40,746
as the hijackers demand the
release of political prisoners...

1063
02:06:40,747 --> 02:06:43,474
including the RAF
prisoners in Stammheim.

1064
02:06:46,568 --> 02:06:49,267
As the hijack drama continues...

1065
02:06:49,543 --> 02:06:54,199
...reported to have
shot the pilot...

1066
02:06:54,496 --> 02:06:57,626
...threatened to kill one
passenger every 5 minutes...

1067
02:06:57,746 --> 02:07:03,222
The Pope has sent a plea for
the release of the passengers.

1068
02:07:04,097 --> 02:07:06,909
At Aden airport,
passengers and crew...

1069
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:09,722
...swap for prisoners...

1070
02:07:09,981 --> 02:07:12,872
...have arrived in Cairo...

1071
02:07:12,992 --> 02:07:16,638
...prisoners in his country will be...

1072
02:07:16,758 --> 02:07:20,680
...emergency landing!

1073
02:07:28,376 --> 02:07:33,157
Baader Meinhof Gang terrorists who
are also holding Hanns-Martin Schleyer...

1074
02:07:33,277 --> 02:07:37,831
...passenger swap in Dubai.

1075
02:07:37,951 --> 02:07:43,755
...do not condone the
actions of political gangsters.

1076
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:47,149
Comrade, they turned us down.

1077
02:07:52,192 --> 02:07:54,146
And where does that leave us?

1078
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:57,586
Everything's gone wrong! Everything!

1079
02:08:03,155 --> 02:08:08,318
They've taken off again.
One pilot shot.

1080
02:08:08,736 --> 02:08:12,504
The plan was to stay in Aden.

1081
02:08:12,624 --> 02:08:16,120
What does it mean?

1082
02:08:17,357 --> 02:08:21,660
Baby. This thing is complete bullshit.

1083
02:08:23,002 --> 02:08:28,590
...landed in Somalia yesterday.

1084
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:33,514
The body of pilot Jürgen
Schumann was dumped...

1085
02:08:33,634 --> 02:08:36,940
...before taking off again.

1086
02:08:53,813 --> 02:08:56,678
We cannot intervene, even if...

1087
02:08:56,798 --> 02:09:01,316
we could actually speak with them.

1088
02:09:01,997 --> 02:09:05,887
We do not approve of
killing innocent civilians.

1089
02:09:08,466 --> 02:09:12,155
The Federal Government,
unlike ourselves,

1090
02:09:12,275 --> 02:09:15,781
goes too far, is too violent.

1091
02:09:20,256 --> 02:09:22,859
I want to see the prison chaplain.

1092
02:09:23,202 --> 02:09:25,626
Whatever happens, it's not our doing.

1093
02:09:25,995 --> 02:09:28,434
Our policies are far more measured.

1094
02:09:28,554 --> 02:09:30,118
Do you really believe that?

1095
02:09:30,377 --> 02:09:32,800
Last month, 8 children
were left fatherless.

1096
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:37,759
We have no control over
the actions of those outside.

1097
02:09:39,195 --> 02:09:42,653
We will be judged by
generations to come.

1098
02:09:43,334 --> 02:09:46,591
If Schleyer escapes, good.
I'm tired of it.

1099
02:09:49,101 --> 02:09:51,042
I wish to request...

1100
02:09:51,162 --> 02:09:54,251
materials to make a will.

1101
02:09:54,684 --> 02:09:57,523
The full legal documents, if possible.

1102
02:09:57,820 --> 02:10:02,794
And I'd like some help
in filling it out properly.

1103
02:10:02,914 --> 02:10:03,740
But Miss Ennslin...

1104
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:08,072
With that done, I will
no longer fear my fate.

1105
02:10:08,192 --> 02:10:12,348
But surely you don't feel
that you are in danger?

1106
02:10:13,065 --> 02:10:15,780
I could die at any time.

1107
02:10:16,849 --> 02:10:18,589
You know what is going on outside...

1108
02:10:19,408 --> 02:10:22,784
that they're trying
to get us out of here.

1109
02:10:23,072 --> 02:10:25,999
That fight has international dimensions.

1110
02:10:26,438 --> 02:10:28,308
What are you getting at?

1111
02:10:29,207 --> 02:10:31,532
I ask you this:

1112
02:10:31,841 --> 02:10:35,532
Wouldn't they prefer
to see me vanish?

1113
02:10:36,682 --> 02:10:39,024
Many states would want that.

1114
02:10:39,296 --> 02:10:42,630
In Western industrial countries
the power structures...

1115
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:46,304
are not so secure that they would wish...

1116
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:51,552
to encourage a new wave
of resistance groups to develop.

1117
02:10:51,829 --> 02:10:54,772
What is your influence
on the current situation?

1118
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:58,518
Free us, and the current
actions will be successful.

1119
02:10:58,519 --> 02:11:01,786
Would the government
want that to happen?

1120
02:11:02,254 --> 02:11:04,254
The judges and the politicians,

1121
02:11:04,374 --> 02:11:08,140
they want to avoid
that at all costs.

1122
02:11:18,938 --> 02:11:23,611
Miss Ennslin, I hope
we can continue to meet.

1123
02:11:24,673 --> 02:11:27,505
Farewell, father.

1124
02:11:44,364 --> 02:11:48,447
We have just recieved confirmation...

1125
02:11:48,567 --> 02:11:51,870
the Luftahansa terrorist
hijacking has ended...

1126
02:11:51,871 --> 02:11:55,173
with all of the 86
passengers safely rescued.

1127
02:11:55,293 --> 02:11:59,315
A spokesman for the Ministry
of the Interior has confirmed...

1128
02:11:59,593 --> 02:12:05,612
that a German anti-terrorist
squad stormed the plane last night.

1129
02:12:05,732 --> 02:12:09,110
The Bonn government
has issued a statement...

1130
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:13,945
"... refused to release
the jailed terrorists. "

1131
02:12:14,065 --> 02:12:21,236
...these brutal actions
have not suceeded. "

1132
02:13:14,448 --> 02:13:17,740
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1133
02:13:25,647 --> 02:13:28,691
Mr Raspe.

1134
02:13:32,514 --> 02:13:35,488
Miss Möller. Miss Möller.

1135
02:13:35,761 --> 02:13:37,810
Alive.

1136
02:13:45,056 --> 02:13:47,089
Miss Ennslin.

1137
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:59,197
The pigs really did it.

1138
02:13:59,653 --> 02:14:03,019
They killed all of them!
- Enough.

1139
02:14:03,139 --> 02:14:06,613
But they killed them all!
- Open murder!

1140
02:14:07,068 --> 02:14:09,833
They sacrificed themselves.
The time was not right.

1141
02:14:11,654 --> 02:14:14,532
What? Are you joking? What do you mean?

1142
02:14:14,795 --> 02:14:17,592
They were at risk.

1143
02:14:17,712 --> 02:14:20,340
Get them out immediately! Immediately!

1144
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:22,827
Those were your words.

1145
02:14:31,603 --> 02:14:36,591
They knew the risks.
They had their alternatives.

1146
02:14:38,483 --> 02:14:41,036
They made their choices.

1147
02:14:41,638 --> 02:14:44,922
What happened was their own doing.

1148
02:14:53,668 --> 02:14:56,960
And Ulrike?

1149
02:14:58,447 --> 02:15:00,995
Her, too.

1150
02:15:04,818 --> 02:15:07,190
I think they recognised...

1151
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:10,871
that the end had come.

1152
02:15:44,824 --> 02:15:47,934
Belgian - French border
